=====================================================================

Sydney personnel are anticipating the arrival of new Prom's for the 
Racal mux that is being used for the Sydney-Melbourne path.  I hope
that maybe you can check upon the status of this equipment, and see
if it has actually been sent yet, to the land down under.

			Thanks in advance, Clinton
