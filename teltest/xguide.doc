                        TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE



               This  chapter  is  to   be   used   as   a   guide   to
          troubleshooting.  The general type of problem is listed as a
          section heading in this chapter.  Further details to aid  in
          solving the problem will be found under the section heading.



          2.1  IF THE SLOT HAS CRASHED,

          1.  Get into the slot with NAD.

          2.  If a message is printed  out  upon  entering  the  slot,
              write it down for later reference.

          3.  Do a ::?VERN to get the version number of both the  slot
              AND of ISIS.

          4.  Do a ::?HIST to  see  if  the  slot  has  been  crashing
              frequently in the recent past.  

          5.  Try to determine what  external  circumstances  preceded
              the crash.

          6.  Record the results.  

          7.  If CRSTOP has been set, dump the slot  with  LOADII  and
              restart  the  slot.  Always attach the symbol table from
              the corresponding NIB file to the dump file  soon  after
              the dump completes.

          8.  If CRSTOP has not been set, look at the crash table.

          9.  If the crash code is 10 (dispatcher crash),

              1.  Try to determine  the  circumstances  preceding  the
                  crash.  

              2.  Try to reproduce the crash.
          X.25/X.75 FIELD GUIDE                               Page 2-2
          Troubleshooting guide


              3.  If the crash cannot be reproduced, enable CRSTOP and
                  BUFTRC  and  get  a  dump of the slot after the next
                  crash.


         10.  If the crash code is 14 (protection  violation),  or  if
              the  crashes  occur  frequently, see if the cause of the
              crash can be determined solely from the crash table.  

                   If more information is needed, set CRSTOP,  BUFTRC,
              and  HDWTRC.  Start the hardware trace in the background
              or foreground, depending  on  whether  the  halfword  at
              CRAT+4C  is  zero or nonzero.  Get a dump after the slot
              crashes.  

              CAUTION:   Starting  a  hardware  trace  will  place   a
              significant drain on the CPU, so the trace should not be
              used in heavily loaded configurations.

         11.  and if circumstances require a slot dump after  a  crash
              but the customer will not allow the slot to be down long
              enough to permit a dump, enable  the  appropriate  trace
              switches and write a patch that will save away the trace
              tables in PATCH0 after a crash.  

                   A reasonable place to put a jump to the patch  area
              is ENTRY1.  Be sure to save registers before executing a
              patch and restore registers after a patch  execution  is
              complete.   Make sure any table pointers are also saved.
              P1SIZE and P0SIZE may need to be increased in  order  to
              do this.


               Decipher the crash table and determine the cause of the
          crash.   As  a  minimum  the  following  information must be
          obtained:

          1.  Crash count,

          2.  Crash type,

          3.  Crash location, specified as a label plus displacement,

          4.  Locations of executable code contained in the registers,
              specified as a label plus displacement.


               Refer to the appropriate source  listing  to  determine
          the   cause  of  the  crash.   Take  note  of  the  comments
          pertaining to the lines of code near the crash location.

               If trace tables are available, use them in  conjunction
          with the crash table to pinpoint the cause of the crash.

          Troubleshooting guide


               Submit  any  findings   to   your   technical   support
          representative:

          1.  If you are able to determine the reason for  the  crash,
              submit  a  problem report.  If you have designed a patch
              to solve the problem, include it in the problem  report.
              Technical  support  will  review  the patch and will see
              that it is made available for distribution.  

          2.  If you are unable to determine the reason for the crash,
              submit whatever you have found to your technical support
              representative.   Be  sure  to  include  the  names  and
              location of ALL relevant files (e.g., Tym files, command
              files, NIB files, dump files, trace files, etc.)




          2.2  IF PROBLEMS APPEAR AT THE FRAME OR PACKET LEVEL,

          1.  First make sure the interface options have been selected
              correctly.    An   option   change  may  solve  all  the
              complaints.

          2.  If the customer  complains  of  problems  at  the  frame
              level,  install  the  frame  trace  patch to allow frame
              viewing through DDT.

          3.  If the customer complains  of  problems  at  the  packet
              level,  install  the  packet  trace patch to allow frame
              viewing through DDT.  

          4.  Get into the slot with NAD.

          5.  If a message is printed  out  upon  entering  the  slot,
              write it down for later reference.

          6.  Recreate the problem while  the  trace  is  active.   In
              order  to  capture the trace as it flits by your screen,
              use CIAO or AUXIO to save the output from DDT in a  file
              for   later   examination.    CIAO   is   documented  in
              (DNDUTIL)CIAO.DOC.

          7.  Examine the trace  and  submit  your  findings  to  your
              technical  support  representative.   Be sure to include
              the names and location of ALL relevant files (e.g.,  Tym
              files,  command  files,  NIB  files,  dump  files, trace
              files, etc.)

IF THE SLOT SHOWS NO RESPONSE 


          2.3  IF THE SLOT SHOWS NO RESPONSE 

          (i.e., user and/or host  receive  no  response,  IRING/ORING
          pointers  do not move, etc., even though user/host claims to
          be sending data), 

          1.  Get into the slot with NAD.

          2.  If a message is printed  out  upon  entering  the  slot,
              write it down for later reference.

          3.  Use DDT to check CPU usage to see if the slot  is  using
              an  abnormally  large  amount  of  CPU.  The slot may be
              caught in a loop.

          4.  Check IRING/ORING pointers to see if they  are  unequal.
              Normally the code moves fast enough so that the pointers
              are usually seen to be equal.  If there are unequal  and
              remain so, the code may be caught in a loop.

          5.  Check the background and foreground PSD to  see  if  the
              address  changes.   If  things are moving slow enough to
              see the address change, you've  located  the  code  area
              caught in a loop.

              1.  Take some sample readings of the PSD that is  moving
                  and    determine    the    locations   (label   plus
                  displacement) to which they refer.  

              2.  Go to the appropriate source listing and examine the
                  area  of  code  that  is having the problem.  Try to
                  determine what could be causing the code to loop.  

              3.  Submit  your  findings  to  your  technical  support
                  representative.


          6.  If everything appears to be normal, but  data  does  not
              seem  to be passing over the link, the link hardware may
              be having trouble.

              1.  If the link is SIO, check the SIO status  SIOTn  for
                  link n.

              2.  If the link is bisync, check the  condition  of  the
                  bisync rotors.

                              SIO STATUS



               For details  concerning  SIO,  see  (ISISDOC)DEVICE.DOC
          (section  2)  and (ISISDOC)ISIS2.DOC (section 4, motherboard
          serial SIO SVC's).

               The status of an SIO can be output through DDT  if  the
          XSIO  routine  is  available.   See  chapter  on  diagnostic
          routines.

               The status of SIO line n can be determined by reading

                                SIOTn

          for  0Ex  bytes.   The  SIO   status   has   the   following
          interpretation:

                       READ               SENSE   INTERRUPT   TIME OF
                      STATUS              STATUS    STATUS   INTERRUPT
            __________________________    ______    ______    ______

          Each status is detailed in the following sections.



          4.1  READ STATUS

               Read status is divided into the registers,  counts  and
          flags shown below:

               The IDLE COUNT is incremented when an HDLC idle line is
          detected.

               The CRC COUNT is a count of CRC errors.

               The ABORT COUNT is incremented when an  HDLC  abort  is
          detected or the line begins an idle state.

               The  registers  and  flags  will  be  detailed  in  the
          following diagrams:

                        CURRENT SECTOR SECADR



               The output buffers contain data to be sent out over the
          X link.  Each packet is placed in a separate buffer, and the
          addresses of all buffers for a particular line are kept in a
          table.   Each  table  has  a  pointer  associated with it to
          indicate the buffer address where the latest packet is to be
          placed.


                    SECADR  is a table of pointers  to  output  sector
                            buffers.    Each   entry   is  a  fullword
                            containing  an  absolute  address   of   a
                            buffer.

                    CURSEC  is a byte array of pointers, one byte  per
                            link,   into  the  set  of  output  sector
                            addresses in SECADR.   CURSEC  contains  a
                            word  displacement  into SECADR and points
                            to the next  available  entry  in  SECADR.
                            The  number  of sectors allotted each link
                            in SECADR is equal to the value of  K  for
                            that link.  

                    K.n     is the value of K for link n.  

                    SECBIA  is a halfword array  containing  the  bias
                            into SECADR for an individual link.


               So, for link n, the value contained in the halfword 

                                  SECBIA + 2*n

          should be added to SECADR  to  find  the  beginning  of  the
          output sector buffer pointers for link n.  This value should
          be added to the value in the byte 

                                   CURSEC + n

          to determine the next SECADR entry for link n.

          Current sector SECADR


               The debugging aid XOSTR will print the  output  sectors
          through  DDT  if  XOSTR  is  available.   See the chapter on
          debugginng aids.

               Of course, the easiest  situation  to  examine  is  the
          interface  with  a  single  link.   In that case the byte at
          CURSEC is the displacement into SECADR.   SECADR  will  have
          K.0 entries in it.


          EXAMPLE:  Read and interpret the output sectors for link 0.

          *:r cursec,10
          0014F  01  0202  0400  0000  0400  0000  0000  0000  0000

          The displacement is 01, so the latest entry is 60520 and the
          oldest  entry  is  605B0.   Read  these  buffers in order to
          determine their contents.  Usually 20x bytes  is  sufficient
          to view the entire frame;  if more information is necessary,
          the first halfword of the buffer is the byte  count  of  the
          frame:

                              BUFFERLETS



               The debugging aid XDBUF will display  the  contents  of
          the  bufferlets  through DDT if XDBUF is available.  See the
          chapter on diagnostic routines.

               Bufferlets are divided into sections by uses:

          1.  DIBUF - dispatcher to internal buffer

          2.  IDBUF - internal to dispatcher buffer

          3.  IECBUF - internal to external (control) buffer

          4.  IEDBUF - internal to external (data) buffer

          5.  FACBUF - facility buffer

          These five labels designate halfword locations that  contain
          indexes  into various the bufferlet arrays.  Given an index,
          the buffer type can be determined by comparing the index  to
          the various biases corresponding to the buffers:

          1.  DIBIA - dispatcher to internal buffer bias

          2.  IDBIA - internal to dispatcher buffer bias

          3.  IECBIA - internal to external (control) buffer bias

          4.  IEDBIA - internal to external (data) buffer bias

          5.  FACBIA - facility buffer bias

          These biases are the first  buffer  index  for  that  buffer
          type.

               The fullword arrays BB  and  BE  are  pointers  to  the
          beginning  and  end  of  the  buffer, respectively.  Each is
          indexed by the buffer index..

          Bufferlets


               Each buffer is composed of a chain of bufferlets.  Each
          bufferlet  is  20x  bytes long, and the last halfword of the
          bufferlet is a forward pointer to the pointer  of  the  next
          bufferlet in the chain.  All pointers are displacements from
          the beginning of the bufferlet area BUFERS.  The halfword at
          BUFERS  is  a  pointer to the last bufferlet released to the
          free pool.

                       FRAME TRACE TABLE FTRTBL



               The frame trace table is a record  of  the  interface's
          view  of  the frames that have passed over the X link in the
          recent past.  Frames are encoded as entries  in  a  circular
          buffer with the following labels:



                    FTRTBL  location of the table

                    FTRINP  halfword containing  a  byte  displacement
                            into FTRTBL that points to the location of
                            the next available table position

                    FTRLEN  length of the table in bytes


               Each entry consists of  2  halfwords  (for  mod  8;   3
          halfwords   for   mod   128  and  FML)  with  the  following
          interpretation:  


              Mod 8:    Byte      (4 bytes per entry)
                          0       line number +80 for output,

          of  the control fields.  They can be found in the listing at
          the  label  PRIDEC.   The  state  depends  on  whether   the

          Frame trace table FTRTBL


               The  control  field  defines  the  frame  types.    For
          supervisory and unnumbered frames, the types are as follows:

                                     _
                  x1    RR N(R)       |   where x = 2*N(R)
                  x5    RNR N(R)      |   (x will be odd if
                  x9    REJ N(R)     _|   P/F bit OR'ed in)
                  0F    SARM (LAP)/DM (LAPB) (1F if P/F bit on)
                  2F    SABM                 (3F if P/F bit on)
                  43    DISC                 (53 if P/F bit on)
                  63    UA                   (73 if P/F bit on)
                  87    FRMR                 (97 if P/F bit on)

          Information frames are of the form 

                                       xy

          where x = 2*N(R) and y = 2*N(S).  Note that y is always even
          (y  = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E).  If a P-bit is present, it is
          added to 2*N(R), making x odd.

               The debugging aid XFTRACE will display the contents  of
          the  frame  trace table through DDT if XFTRACE is available.
          See the chapter on diagnostic routines.


          EXAMPLE:  Read and decipher  the  frame  trace  table.   The

               The halfword contents of FTRINP is a displacement  into
          FTRTBL  indicating  the  position  of  the  next entry to be
          entered.  This means the location of the oldest entry in the
          table is

                 FTRTBL + 0238 = 8066A + 0238 = 808A2

                      PACKET TRACE TABLE PTRTBL



               The packet trace table is a record of  the  interface's
          view  of the packets that have passed over the X link in the
          recent past.  Packets are encoded as entries in  a  circular
          buffer with the following labels:



                    PTRTBL  location of the table

                    PTRINP  halfword containing  a  byte  displacement
                            into  PTRTBL  pointing  to the location of
                            the next available table position.

                    PTRLEN  length of the table in bytes


               Each entry consists of  3  halfwords  (for  mod  8;   4
          halfwords for mod 128) with the following interpretation:  


            Mod 8:    Byte       (6 bytes per entry)
                        0        80 for output, 00 for input, 
                                 +01 if illegal packet,
                                 +02 if Q bit set
                        1        line number
                        2,3      external channel number
                        4        actual packet type 
                        5        channel state

            Mod 128:  Byte       (8 bytes per entry)
                        0 - 4    same as Mod 8
                        5        control 2 byte or cause byte
                        6        00 or diagnostic byte
                        7        channel state


          NOTE:  Cause will be displayed as received.  In the case  of
          a  nonzero  clear,  reset,  or restart cause received from a
          DTE, this cause will be reset to zero before being put  into
          the network.

          A data packet is not listed in the table above.  The  packet
          type  of  a  data packet is always even.  The semi-octets of
          the type are 2*P(S) and 2*P(R), in that order.



               The channel states are as follows:

               The debugging aid XPTRACE will display the contents  of
          the  packet trace table through DDT if XPTRACE is available.

          The pointer PTRINP contains the  displacement  18C,  meaning
          the next trace entry will be at location 

                  PTRTBL + 18C = 8037E + 18C = 8050A


               Starting at location 8050A, break the table into  units
          of 3 halfwords each (for mod 8), separating input and output

                    SYNC LINE TRACE BUFFER HISTAB



               If the symbol BUFTRC is defined and has a value greater
          than  0,  then  a  trace  of  all  GCI and WCI calls will be
          included in a circular table with the following labels:



                    HISTAB  location of the circular table

                    HISX    a halfword containing a byte  displacement
                            into  HISTAB  to  the position of the next
                            available entry in HISTAB

                    HISTSZ  number of one word entries in HISTAB


               HISTAB  will  contain  one  word  entries  defined   as
          follows:

                  Byte    Contents
          
                  0      character
                  1      buffer number
                  2-3    address of routine calling GCI/WCI


               If the symbol HISTSZ is defined, the number of one word
          entries  in  HISTAB  will be set to that number;  otherwise,
          the value of 100x one word entries  will  be  used.   HISTSZ
          must be a power of 2 not greater than 2000x.

               The history table is especially useful when  attempting
          to  determine  the reason for the appearance of a particular
          character in an ORING/IRING message.  In general HISTAB will
          contain a record of all calls to WCI/GCI.

               The pointer in the halfword HISX is 538x, so  the  next
          entry will be placed at

                    HISTAB + 538 = 3F2 + 538 = 92A

          The fullword entry at that location is

                              FF0D  61C0

          meaning  the  oldest  entry  indicates  WCI/GCI  passed  the
          character  FF  using  buffer  number  0D,  and called by the
          routine at location 161C0 (since executable code is  located
          in segment 1, 10000x must be added to 61C0).

               The newest entry is just  before  the  oldest  one  and
          indicates  that WCI/GCI passed the character 00 using buffer
          number 07 and called by the routine at 118BA.

               One may now work backwards from the newest entry  until

                     HARDWARE TRACE TABLE TRCADR



               If the symbol HDWTRC is defined and set  to  1  in  the
          command  file, the hardware trace option is assembled.  This
          code allows the tracing of  the  last  32  jumps  (lower  16
          bits).

          CAUTION:  To avoid confusing the slot code,  DO  NOT  ENABLE
          BOTH the background and the foreground trace during the same
          period of time.  Either trace may  be  running  at  any  one
          time, but both should not be run simultaneously.

               To enable a trace, enter --

                       :W BEXPSD,1000 for background

                       OR (not and)

                       :W FEXPSD,1000 for foreground

               To disable, enter --


                       :W BEXPSD,0 for background

                       :W FEXPSD,0 for foreground


          TRCADR  contains the last 32 jumps (40x bytes total)

          TRCPTR  is a halfword containing a  byte  displacement  into
                  TRCADR  that  points  past  the  last  entry used in
                  TRCADR

          TRCREG  contains the registers at time of last jump

          TRCPAT  is a UPSW instruction to continue followed by an 80x
                  byte   patch   area  which  can  be  used  to  patch
                  additional trace code.  Be sure  to  end  the  patch
                  with UPSW.

                   PACKET BUFFER TRACE TABLE PBTTBL



               The packet buffer trace table is a table of pointers to
          the  buffers  containing  packets  received from the X link.
          This  is  useful  for  examining  the  sequence  of  packets
          received   over  the  link  during  the  recent  past.   The
          following labels  are  associated  with  the  packet  buffer
          trace:



                    PBTTBL  location of  the  circular  packet  buffer
                            trace table

                    PBTINP  halfword containing  a  byte  displacement
                            into  PBTTBL  where the next entry will be
                            placed

                    PBTLEN  length of PBTTBL in bytes


               Each entry of PBTTBL is 4 bytes long:

                 Byte    Interpretation
          
                  0      Link number
                  1-3    Absolute buffer address


               In  order  to  see  what  was  actually  received,  the
          absolute buffer addresses must be read (20x bytes usually is
          enough).  Each buffer starts with a halfword pointer to  the
          next  buffer,  followed  by  a  halfword containing the byte
          count of the packet that follows.

          The halfword pointer PBTINP contains a 0C, so the next entry
          will be placed at

                   PBTTBL + 0C = 803EA + 0C = 803F6

          At that location the fullword contains 50C1E.  This  is  the
          address  of  the  oldest  buffer.  Starting here and working
          through the buffers will give an indication  of  the  latest
          packets received by the interface.

          This buffer says next buffer will be at location 51028.  The
          packet is 12x bytes long and is a call connected packet.

          The next buffer will be  at  location  51432.   This  buffer
          contains  a  packet  that  is  3 bytes long and is a Receive
          Ready with P(R) = 0.

          The next buffer will be  at  location  5183C.   This  buffer
          contains another 3 bytes of Receive Ready packet with P(R) =

                        RECEIVE BUFFERS RBUFN



               The  receive  buffers  RBUF0,  RBUF1,  ...,  RBUFn  are
          buffers  that  contain  the frames received by the interface
          over the n X lines.  Each buffer is RBUFHS  halfwords  long.
          Each  variable  length  entry  is  preceded  by  a  halfword
          indicating the number of bytes in  the  frame.   The  length
          always  starts  on  a halfword boundary.  Unfortunately, the
          length of the first entry gets wiped out, so its length must
          be  guessed.   The  end  of  valid  data is indicated by the
          halfword FFFF.

               RINDEX is a halfword  array,  one  halfword  per  line,
          whose  entries  are  byte  displacements into RBUFn.  RINDEX
          entries point to the next entry to  be  processed.   If  the
          halfword  so  indicated  is 0FFFF instead of a positive byte
          count, then no new entries have been received.


          EXAMPLE:  Read the receive buffer for line 0.

               If the link is bisync, the receive buffer is harder  to
          read because the bits are reversed.

                 BISYNC INTERRUPT RECEIVE RING STRTBL



               The  bisync  receive  ring  is  a  circular  table   of
          characters  received  in RBUF, but the bits are inverted for
          easier viewing.  The following labels  are  associated  with
          this table:



                    STRTBL  location of the table

                    STRINP  fullword pointer containing the address of
                            the  location  for  the  next  entry  into
                            STRTBL

                    STRLEN  length of STRTBL in bytes

                    ACCOUNTING TRACE BUFFER ATRTBL



               A circular table is available for examining  accounting
          messages  that have been sent into the network in the recent
          past.  The accounting trace is activated with the  debugging
          switch ACTRAC.  The table has the following relevant labels:



                    ATRTBL  location of the accounting trace table

                    ATRINP  halfword containing  a  byte  displacement
                            into ATRTBL indicating the position of the
                            next available entry in ATRTBL

                    ATRLEN  length of ATRTBL in bytes


               Each entry is a  fullword  in  length,  partitioned  by
          halfwords as follows:

                          Byte    Contents
          
                          0-1     Dispatcher port number
                          2-5     Accounting message
                          6-7     Terminating flag FFFF

               The first four bits of the message will be  "E",  which
          is  to  define  this as an ISIS accounting addendum message.
          The second four bits is  the  accounting  addendum  subtype.
          The  format of the remainder of the message is determined by
          this subtype.  See ACOUNT.DOC for more detail.

               Each type has a label of  the  form  "AA.*"  associated
          with it:

              Label    Type       Interpretation

                         DIAGNOSTIC ROUTINES



               DDT diagnostic routines are  assembled  into  the  code
          when the assembly switch DDTDIA is nonzero.

               In XCOM versions 2.02 through 2.05 each  diagnostic  is
          activated  by  a command to the command processor, activated
          by "?STAT".

               Each diagnostic in XCOM version 2.01 is activated by  a
          command  of  the  form  "::G  xxxx"  if  one enters the slot
          through NAD.  If the slot is entered directly,  the  ::   is
          not to be used.  

               A diagnostic must be reactivated each time it is to  be
          used.

               If you wish to save the diagnostic output  in  a  file,
          run everything through AUXIO or CIAO.



          16.1  DIAGNOSTIC ROUTINE INDEX

               In XCOM versions 2.02 through 2.05 the DDT query  ?STAT
          will  start  the  STATUS.LIB command processor.  The command
          processor is capable of understanding alphabetic strings  in
          addition  to  numeric  values.  The processor prompts with a
          "-->".

               One may ask for help with the command  "H"  or  "HELP".
          The following response will be returned:

          HELP  Prints this list          QUIT  Returns to DDT
          BH    Bufferlet dump in hex     BA    Bufferlet dump in ascii
          BHN   Non-empty dump in hex     BAN   Non-empty dump in ascii
          PFT   Packet and frame trace    PT    Packet trace
          FT    Frame trace               PB    Packet buffer trace
          RI    Input ring trace          RO    Output ring trace

          The exact diagnostic routines available will depend  on  the
          XCOm   version.   These  diagnostics  may  be  activated  by
          entering the appropriate command at the "-->" prompt.   This
          may be done directly or through NAD.

          EXAMPLE:  Activate the command processor in a slot  and  ask
          for  help.   Start the packet trace.  Assume you are working
          through NAD.
          
          *::?stat
          
          -->::help
          
          HELP  Prints this list          QUIT  Returns to DDT
          BH    Bufferlet dump in hex     BA    Bufferlet dump in ascii
          BHN   Non-empty dump in hex     BAN   Non-empty dump in ascii
          PFT   Packet and frame trace    PT    Packet trace
          FT    Frame trace               PB    Packet buffer trace
          RI    Input ring trace          RO    Output ring trace
          AVE   Measurement averaging     LNKS  Dump Link variables
          IPRT  Dump IPORT variables      DPRT  Dump DPORT variables
          GPKT  Packet(s) seq control     SEND  Send packet once
          CREG  Move crash reg to DDT     TCAN  Trash-can link data
          VUE   Real-time monitor         DPKT  Define test packets
          REM   Remark comment line       PAWS  Pause command proc
          SIO   SIO interpreter           OS    Output sector trace
          LINE  Dump LINE variables       ERROR Global error counters
          DMY1  Spare Diagnostic          DMY2  Spare Diagnostic
          
          -->::pt
          
          The  packet  trace  diagnostic  will then prompt you for any
          additional information it needs.

               In XCOM version 2.01 the DDT query ?STAT will  start  a
          routine  that  indicates which DDT diagnostics are available
          in the slot.  The address and a short description  are  also
          included.

               This  facility  is  particularly  useful  when  it   is
          necessary to dump tables, but the full symbol table from NAD
          is not really needed.


          EXAMPLE:  Enter the slot with NAD  and  activate  the  index
          routine.

               To start a particular diagnostic in XCOM version  2.01,
          type 

                               ::G location<cr>

          "location" is the numeric address given in the index or,  if
          the  NIB  symbol table is available through NAD, the routine
          name.

               Of course, if the slot is entered directly, the ::   is
          unnecessary.



          16.2  PACKET/FRAME TRACE TABLE TRACE

               To execute the diagnostic via DDT in XCOM versions 2.02
          through 2.05, type 

          ::PFT<cr>  to see both packet and frame trace,
                            or
          ::PT<cr>   to see just the packet trace table PTRTBL
                            or
          ::FT<cr>   to see just the frame trace FTRTBL.


               To execute the diagnostic via DDT in XCOM version 2.01,
          type

          ::G XTRACE<cr>    to see both packet and frame trace,
                            or
          ::G XPTRACE<cr>   to see just the packet trace table PTRTBL
                            or
          ::G XFTRACE<cr>   to see just the frame trace FTRTBL.

          When you get the prompt "SEC=", the routine  wants  to  know
          the number of seconds you wish the trace to run.  Reply with

               A "P" indicates a packet;  an "F", a  frame.   Each  of
          the  frame  and  packet trace tables is processed completely
          before the other table is  processed,  so  the  packets  and
          frames  will  not  be  intermixed  as they should be in real
          time.

               To execute the trace via DDT IN  XCOM  version  2.01  ,
          type

                                ::G XDRING<cr>

          When you get the prompt "+", the routine wants  to  know  if
          you want to look at the IRING or the ORING.  Reply with 

                            ::I<cr> for the IRING
                            ::O<cr> for the ORING
                            ::B<cr> for both rings

          The trace will start at the top of the  ring  and  translate
          until   it  reaches  the  position  indicated  by  the  ring
          pointers.  Note that this means that if  the  ring  pointers
          are  zero,  nothing  will  be dumped;  in this case, use the
          "wrap" function described below.

               If both rings are requested, the IRING will  be  dumped
          first, followed by the ORING 

               If you wish the entire  ring  dumped,  use  the  "wrap"
          command

                            ::WI<cr> for the IRING
                            ::WO<cr> for the ORING
                            ::WB<cr> for both rings

          This tells the diagnostic to start at the oldest ring  entry
          and "wrap" if necessary to dump the rest of the ring.  

               If you wish the trace to continue to  trace  the  ring,
          type

              ::Iseconds<cr> or ::WIseconds<cr> for the IRING
              ::Oseconds<cr> or ::WOseconds<cr> for the ORING
              ::Bseconds<cr> or ::WBseconds<cr> for both rings

          where "seconds" is the number of seconds  the  trace  should
          continue.   If  both rings are requested, new IRING messages

          Diagnostic routines


          will be displayed  followed  by  new  ORING  messages.   The
          interleaving  of  IRING/ORING  messages  may be close to the
          actual order of arrival in the respective ring, but this  is
          not  guaranteed.  The heavier the data load, the smaller the
          guarantee.

          NOTE:  Under  certain  circumstances,  the  trace  may  have
          difficulty  finding  the first ISIS message.  If that is the
          case, the trace may not work.

               The routine will  print  the  buffer  numbers  and  the
          contents of the bufferlets in hex.  The command

          ::BA<cr>         (versions 2.02 through 2.05)
          
          ::G XDBUFA<cr>   (version 2.01)

          will print the contents in ASCII.  

          NOTE:  Non-printable ASCII will be sent to the  terminal  if
          it  is  in  the  buffer.   Some terminals may interpret this
          ASCII stream and do unexpected things.

               If only non-empty bufferlets are needed, type

          ::BHN<cr>        (versions 2.02 through 2.05)
          
          ::G XNBUF<cr>    (version 2.01)
          
          or
          
          ::BAN<cr>        (versions 2.02 through 2.05)
          
          ::G XNBUFA<cr>   (version 2.01)

          for hex or ASCII display, respectively.

          16.5  PACKET BUFFER TRACE TABLE DUMP

               This routine dumps packets received as indicated by the
          packet  buffer  trace  table PBTTBL.  It is activated by the
          command

          ::PT<cr>        (version 2.02 through 2.05)
          
          ::G XPBTR<cr>   (version 2.01)

          The routine  will  prompt  for  the  number  of  seconds  to
          continue dumping by

          16.6  OUTPUT SECTOR DUMP

               This routine dumps  frame  sent  as  indicated  by  the
          output  sectors  listed in table SECADR.  It is activated by
          the command

          ::OS<cr>        (versions 2.02 through 2.05)
          
          ::G XOSTR<cr>   (version 2.01)

          The routine  will  prompt  for  the  number  of  seconds  to
          continue dumping with

          16.8  SELECT ROUTINE

               The SELECT command will allow several diagnostics to be
          run  in  sequence.   A  list  of  choices will be displayed.
          Choose any of the routines listed in any order.  Repeats are
          allowed.   Choices  are  separated  by  any  nonalphanumeric
          chararacter(s).   The  list  is  terminated  by  a   return.
          Routine names that are not recognized will be ignored.

               SELECT will then prompt for specific dispatcher  ports,
          links,  and/or  channels  to  display.   Reply  with numeric
          choices  up  to  4  digits  each,  separated  by  nonnumeric
          characters.  Only the last digits are used.  Any port, link,
          or channel that is NOT specified will be filtered out of the
          display.   Any number specified that is out of range will be
          ignored.  A solitary carriage  return  at  the  prompt  will
          allow  ALL  ports/links/channels  to  be displayed.  A reply
          that consists entirely  of  nonnumerics  and  out  of  range
          values will be treated as a solitary return.

          NOTE:  When making several entries in  SELECT  through  NAD,
          you will probably have to use the %R command.

               SELECT then starts the  diagnostic  routines  in  turn.
          Each output is separated from the output of the next routine
          by a label.  A dismiss is performed after the whole list has
          been run.

               During a run, any character enterd at the terminal will
          interrupt SELECT and bring it back to the ?STAT level.

               The interrupt will not be  noticed  until  the  routine
          that is currently running is finished, so a control-O (%O in
          NAD) will help if you are  impatient.   The  control-O  will
          probably cause you to lose the ?STAT prompt.

               If you are VERY impatient, you may interrupt  out  with
          control-C  (%C  in  NAD), but this will also take you out of
          the ?STAT.


          EXAMPLE:  Use Select to run routines PB,  OS,  BHN,  and  RO
          sequentially.   Only display information about DPORTs 0E and
          10, line 1, and channels 1 and 3.

          *::?stat<cr>

          Diagnostic routines


          -->::Select<cr>
          
          Select routines from the following list:
          
          
          PB    Packet buffer trace       PT    Packet trace
          FT    Frame trace               BHN   Non-empty dump in hex
          RI    Input ring trace          RO    Output ring trace
          OS    Output sector trace
          DMY1  Spare Diagnostic          DMY2  Spare Diagnostic
          
          :%rpb os,bhn  ro<cr>
           
          Enter ports to be displayed: e,10<cr>
          
          Enter lines to be displayed: 1<cr>
          
          Enter channels to be displayed: 3,1<cr>

               At this point the routines PB, OS, BHN,  and  RO  start
          up.   Only  information concerning DPORTs 0E and 10, line 1,
          and  channels  1  and  3  reach  the  screen.   The  display
          continues until some character is typed, causing the display
          to stop.  

          NOTE:  If you are using NAD, don't forget that you must type
          C or ESC to get out of the %r relay mode.

          NOTE:  if you log into the slot directly, it will be  easier
          because  you  don't  have  to  worry about setting any relay
          mode.



          16.8.1  Redo Routine

               REDO will start the routine list set up in the previous
          SELECT.  It can also be interrupted as in SELECT.




          Example:  After the select has  been  interrupted,  run  the
          same routines with the same filters.

          -->::redo<cr>


               The routines will start  up  again  without  having  to
          re-specify the routines and filters.

          Diagnostic routines


          16.8.2  Snap Routine

               SNAP will give a single-shot display  of  the  routines
          set up in the previous SELECT.




          Example:  After the select has been interrupted and the slot
          halted  for  some  reason (say, after a crash), run the same
          routines once with the same filters, but dump out everything
          left in the table (historcal data).

          -->::snap<cr>


               The routines will run once without having to re-specify
          the routines and filters.  All historical data in the tables
          will be displayed.

          Bit 13 set to 0 if the frame rejected was a command.

          In the diagrams above, note the following:

          1.  Rejected frame control field is the control field of the
              received frame which caused the command/frame reject.

          2.  V(S) is the current send state variable at  the  DTE  or
              DCE  reporting  the  rejection condition.  Bit 10 is the
              low order bit.

          CCITT frame commands and responses


          3.  V(R) is the current receive state variable at the DTE or
              DCE  reporting  the  rejection condition.  Bit 14 is the
              low order bit.

          4.  W set to 1 indicates that the control field received and
              returned  in  bits  1  through  8  was  invalid  or  not
              implemented.

          5.  X set to 1 indicates that the control field received and
              returned  in  bits  1  through  8 was considered invalid
              because the frame contained an information  field  which
              is  not  permitted  or is an S or U frame with incorrect
              length.  Bit W must be set to 1 in conjunction with this
              bit.

          6.  Y set to 1 indicates that the information field received
              exceeded  the maximum established capacity of the DTE or
              DCE reporting the rejection condition.  

          7.  Z set to 1 indicates that the control field received and
              returned in bits 1 through 8 contained an invalid N(R).

                           TURKEY MESSAGES



          'TURKEY' IIX DIALECT FOR THE X INTERFACES

          The following describes the  IIX  dialect  employed  by  the
          X.25/ X.75 interfaces, called the "turkey dialect ".

          Specifically, it describes the turkey level 1 of the dialect
          as it has been currently developed.

          This document does not  describe  the  IIX  global  messages
          exchanged prior to the start of turkey dialect talk.

          See "Interface Information Exchange"  document  for  details
          and description of rules and philosophy of IIX.

          The X.25/ X.75 interface offers dialect choices of:
                  X.25/ X.75
                  DSP (by user option only)
                  ASCII data
          in that order.

          1.  ESTABLISHING TURKEY LEVEL

          There will be  many  levels  of  turkey  dialect  as  the  X
          interfaces continue to include new features.

          The first IIX dialect exchanged between two  turkey  talking
          interfaces is the turkey level message.
          The destination interface will send a turkey  level  message
          stating the turkey level it wants to communicate in.
          If it does not receive any turkey level message in return, a
          turkey level of zero is assumed.
          If it does receive a turkey level message, it will take  the
          lesser  of  the  one  it sent and the one it received as the
          final turkey level it will communicate in.  It then confirms
          the  final  level to the other side by sending back a turkey
          level message.

          2.  PASSING ON INCOMING CALLS

          When the X interface gets a Call Request from the X-Line, it
          X.25/X.75 FIELD GUIDE                               Page H-2
          Turkey messages


          sends  a sequence of dialect call request descriptors to the
          network to pass on the call.
          This sequence begins with the  CALLED  ADDRESS  message  and
          ends with the CALL USER DATA message.  
          Detail description of these dialect messages can be found in
          appendix 2.

          A normal call request dialect sequence is as follows:
          
                  CALLED ADDRESS (87)
                  CALLING ADDRESS (88)
                  NETWORK UTILITY FIELD (8C) (if X.75)
                  FACILITIES FIELD (8D)
                  CALL USER DATA FIELD (89)
          
          If the origination has RPOA facility, it is sent via an RPOA
          SELECTION (98)  dialect  message,  before  any  facility  or
          utility message.

          If the orgination is an  X.25  and  has  Closed  User  Group
          facility, it is sent via a NET UTILITY dialect message (8C).
          THus even the call is  from  an  X.25,  it  is  possible  to
          receive  a  utility  message.  We distinguish a call from an
          X.75 verses a call from an X.25 by the presence of a  CALLID
          utility field in the utility dialect message.

          Note that the CALL USER DATA dialect message marks  the  end
          of the call request sequence.

          Data transfer starts after the interface has received a CALL
          ACCEPT dialect message.
          Dialect messages that can be exchanged at this point are:
          
                  DATA (94)
                  INTERRUPT (8A)
                  INTERRUPT CONFIRMATION (8B)
                  RESET CONFIRMATION (91)
                  CLEAR CAUSE/ DIAGNOSTIC (95)
                  RESET CAUSE/ DIAGNOSTIC (96)
                  CLEAR INFORMATION (97)
          
          3.  RECEIVING CALLS FROM THE NETWORK

          We respond to the CALL REQUEST dialect sequence described in
          2.  with a CALL ACCEPT dialect message (92).



               4.  OTHER TOPICS OF INTEREST

          A.  RESET HANDLING

          When a Reset is received from the X-line, a gobbler will  be
          sent  to the network toward the turkey talking host followed
          X.25/X.75 FIELD GUIDE                               Page H-3
          Turkey messages


          by a RESET dialect message.
          A gobbler in return is expected when the other side receives
          the RESET dialect message.

          Until a RESET CONFIRMATION dialect message is received,  the
          interface  is  in  a flush mode, discarding any data it gets
          from the network.

          When a RESET dialect message is received by the interface, a
          gobbler  will  be sent to the network to gobble any messages
          that it has already sent.

          It will pass on the Reset and waits for a Reset Confirmation
          from  the X-line.  While waiting, it is in data packet flush
          mode.
          A complete description of  the  break  handling  done  by  X
          interfaces  can  be found in the document "Break Handling in
          the X Interfaces".  (YET TO BE WRITTEN)

          B.  RECEIVING GOBBLERS


               When receiving a gobbler, the  interface  will  discard
          all  the  data it got from the network that has yet not been
          processed.

          C.  RECEIVING BLACK BALL, GRAY BALL

          The interface sends  a  Reset  over  the  X-line  and  RESET
          dialect message (96).







               APPENDIX I X.25/ X.75 DIALECT FORMAT

          Each dialect message is contained in one or more  ISIS  data
          messages.   On  the  other  hand,  one ISIS data message can
          contain one or more dialect messages.
          A typical dialect message in the ISIS message  format  looks
          like the following:

          PORT / BF (SIIX)
          PORT / LEN DATA1/ DIALECT CODE/ LEN DIALECT/ DIALECT PART 1
          PORT / LEN DATA2/ DIALECT PART 2

                               GLOSSARY



          DNIC:  Data Network Identification Code.  This is  a  number
          composed  of  a  3  digit  country  code plus public network
          identification code.  It is assigned by government  agencies
          to  public data networks.  It is used to address entities on
          a particular public data network.

               Public data networks, data networks  owned  by  foreign
          governments/administrations,  and  IRCs (international recrd
          carriers) have DNICs.  Private  networks  owned  by  private
          corporations  do  not  have DNICs.  Standards for addressing
          private networks from public networks are  under  sturdy  by
          the CCITT.

          TNIC:  Transit Network Identification Code.  This is used to
          identify the DNIC of a particular administration (country or
          IRC) through which a user wishes to transit, and with  which
          the   user's   originating   administration  has  a  transit
          agreement.

          NTN:  Network Terminal Number.  This  is  used  to  identify
          uniquely  a destination "host" on a data network.  In Tymnet
          the first 6 digits of  this  number  correspond  to  a  host
          number.  See (NETMID)XADR.DOC for details.

          NUI:  Network User Identifier.  This  is  used  to  identify
          uniquely  a  caller.   Some  administraions  use the network
          username for this purpose.  It is  the  mechanism  by  which
          they determine who to bill for a given call.

          X.75:  This is a method for interconnecting two public  data
          networks.   It  is a form of a gateway between networks.  In
          this respect it is similar  in  function  to  the  Tymnet  -
          Tymnet gateway;  however, X.75, like X.25, uses HDLC framing
          instead of T201 protocol.

          RPOA:   Recognized  Private  Operating  Agency.    This   is
          generally  used to refer to an International Record Carrier.
          It is also used interchangeably with  TNIC  to  refer  to  a
          transit  network.   The  latter  term  (TNIC)  will probably
          replace it in the future.

          Glossary


          PAD:  Packet Assembler/Disassembler.  This is used to  refer
          to  a  terminal  interface.   The  Tymnet  Tymsat performs a
          number of PAD functions.  The CCITT standard for  a  PAD  is
          described in the X.3/X.29 recommendations.

               Some differences between the existing  Tymsat  and  the
          PAD  are  that the PAD permits a user to change the terminal
          characteristics set up  at  login  at  any  point  during  a
          session.   Further,  rather  than  simply  responding  to  a
          "Please type your  terminal  identifier"  with  a  character
          which  the  network  then  translates  or maps into terminal
          characteristics, the PAD  prompts  are  different,  and  the
          number  of  characteristics  and the form of their entry are
          different.  In Tymnet the PAD will be an option available in
          the  CONSAT.   Thus,  a  user logging into a Tymsat optioned
          with PAD code will be able to utilize  either  the  standard
          Tymsat login or the CCITT PAD login.
