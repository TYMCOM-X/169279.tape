EU/FRJB 8 JUNE 93 - Some news!  The circuit is not built when the               
remote (German) end calls, but the call goes through when I type                
4E under XOM.  And this happens each time the circuit is cut.                   
French customer is currently in Germany waiting for our call and

Here is the situation : according to the CS, when the originating host line     
is turned down and then up, the circuit attempt from host 17519 node 12056 s.3  
kh 6624 to host 16308 node 15010 s.3 kh 17137 gets a 'network: out of channels' 
message that the originating host (17519) passes to the external host as a      
 
 --# 10 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 11-JUN-93 @17:32 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: YES
clear (0, 0) ! A trace is available under ~sfisbein/kleber/trace.ddt .          
My personal investigation leads to a bug in the available port calculation      
logic in the destination slot. APORTS is negative ! If I log into the           
destination's XOM, then the circuit can be built successfully. I have noticed   
 
 --# 11 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 11-JUN-93 @17:32 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: YES
that other circuits are built at the same time, that come from other sources.   
Therefore, the problem shouldn't be located in the originating slot. When the   
problem occurs, there are usually 2 to 3 circuits in use in the destination     
slot, whereas there are 15 tcnl's defined for host 16308.                       
 
 --# 12 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 11-JUN-93 @17:32 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: YES
So we are dealing with a problem in the destination slot where the number of    
active ports does not seem to be properly updated. If STS needs it, you can     
nad-ddt the slot and see what is going on. Unfortunately, I have cleared the    
problem incidently by just logging into XOM ! The only link between a XOM       
 
 --# 13 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 11-JUN-93 @17:32 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: YES
login and an X.25 login is the needle processing.                               
In the meantime, I have succeeded in reproducing the problem. I have left the   
slots in the conditions of the problem. To clear the problem, simply log into   
the destination's XOM (# 11032). And that's it. To reproduce the problem,

     REPORT SENT YET ?: YES
enter hie in the originating slot's ddt. The circuit reconstruction will fail.  
This is weird since there are thousands of circuit reconstructions a day and    
they don't fail all. Could it be an interaction between APORTS and some other   
specific parameter in the tymfile ? Could you try to load the destination
