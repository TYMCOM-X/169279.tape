Subject: Attached summary on encryption.

John,

Here is a brief summary of the encryption study we discussed.
It is very brief,  time constraints preclude a more complete
response. I hope that this will be of use to you in working
with your client.  If there are specific issue you are concerned with
that are not covered here, let me know. I will, when time permits,
expand this summary.

Best regards,

In early 1984, NTD evaluated a number of data encryption devices
for use on a Private Tymnet network.   The devices studied
were selected by the client commissioning the evaluation.

There were three objectives to this study.  First, the devices were
tested to insure that basic network functionality would not be impaired
by encrypting internodal links with external crypto devices.

Basic network functionality was defined, for the purpose of this test, 
to mean that links between network processors could be established,
network software could be loaded across encrypted links, virtual
circuits could be established, and data transmitted.  Further, 
this definition of basic functionality included the ability to
automatically recover from common error conditions - that is, loss
and recovery of a network processor, modem, encryption device, or
line.

Secondly, the devices were tested to evaluate the effect on
network performance (as defined by round trip transmission time)
of transiting encrypted links.

Third, the devices were evaluated in terms of the key management
options and facilities provided by each vendor.  Of particular
interest in this regard, was the extent to which the key
management facilities were amenable to an environment of
remote  distributed processor, and to the potential of
remote automatic key distribution through network facilities.

All of the devices evaluated, were optioned to operate in
bit transparent mode. Some vendors have different devices for
protocol sensitive operation, these were not evaluated.

The devices were tested, in this transparent mode, on
tymnet internodal protocol links, on HDLC X.25 links,
and on BSC3270 links, to insure that they could be
deployed for both link level, and "tail circuit" encryption.


Testing occurred in the NTD development lab in Cupertino.
A line simulator was used to generate noise and phase
jitter in order to evaluate the effect on performance,
of common line error conditions.

The devices evaluated included:
RACAL MILGO DatacryptorII
PARADYNE Infolock
RAN Data encryptor
ANALYTICS Sherlock encryptor

All devices successfully passed network functionality tests.
They varied in their effect on round trip time during the
performance tests.  They also varied in the degree to which they
gracefully handled high line error rates.

As noted above, testing was performed on synchronous links
only. The line speed used was 9.6.  Some of the vendors noted
offer different, asynchronous encryptors. It should be
noted that protocol sensitive block mode encryption is
more efficient than the bit transparent mode used in these test.
However, the nature of a value added packet network environment,'
and the unique Tymnet internodal protocol, precluded use of
protocol sensitive encryption for this testing.
All vendors noted, have indicated a willingness to develop
Tymnet specific protocol encryption should that be deemed desirable.

As noted above, Link level encryption, using external encryption
devices, has been successfully demonstrated to be a viable option
in a Tymnet environment. 

The effect on network round trip time, of transiting an encrypted
link, will vary by device, link quality, packet size, and environment
(that is, internodal link, or BSC 3270, or HDLC X.25).

The devices ranged, during the course of the testing, from
virtually no incremental increase in round trip time, to
incremental increases of up to 240 ms.  On the average,
taking all devices, with small and large packets, medium
and heavy link loads, moderate line noise (D1 conditioning),
one may expect to see approximately a 30 ms increase in round trip time
for a transit across an encrypted link.
One may expect to see the effect of line serious line
impairment somewhat exacerbated by encryption devices, as errors may
be propagated through cipher feed back until resynchronization
occurs.

All devices tested provided , as either standard, or option,
DES encryption. All  offered key distribution facilities 
appropriate to a distributed environment.  None of the
vendors noted currently offer a Key management facility as
envisioned by the ANSI X.9 study group, however, a number of the
vendors either plan to offer such facilities, or have indicated
willingness to develop them. 


One additional comment should be made regarding link vrs
end to end encryption.

As noted above, these devices were tested in a link
encryption environment. There are some applications
where end to end encryption may be used in a Tymnet
environment, however, for the reasons noted below,
end to end encryption is not a generalized option.

More specifically, asynchronous end to end encryption may
be supported on a Tymnet network for those applications
where the establishment of a network virtual circuit between
communicating pairs is automated, and does not require
participation of either end user. For example,
an ALO, (Automated log-on ) or PVC (Permanent Virtual
Circuit) option, permits the necessary interaction with
network control, and routing facilities to take place
in transparent mode. For those applications where the
communicating pairs are pre-determined, that is, the
user at an asynchronous terminal is always communicating
with a specific host, end to end encryption may be supported.

In addition, the Tymnet SNA/SDLC extension cord interface
provides link level support, transparent to higher SNA
protocol layers.  SNA encryption may then also be supported
in this particular environment.  (This support is implemented
via a PVC, such that, again, interactions required to establish
the virtual circuit, take place in transparent mode).

However, in general, End to end encryption using external encryption
devices, in a Value added network environment such as Tymnet's, offers
some interesting challenges.  

Some of the issues in this area, include:

Local Significance
Multi-targeting
Protocol Conversion
Value Added passthroughs


The issue of local significance has been alluded to above with
regard to virtual circuit establishment.

There are interactions, within the network environment, between
the user (caller) and the network origin interface (DCE), between
the origin interface and the network control facilities, and between
the receiver (callee) and the network destination interface (DCE).
Data of local significance, (for example call request prompts,
and virtual circuit construction processes) must be intelligible
and cannot therefore be encrypted by a device which cannot distinguish
user data and control information.


Encryption devices are communicating pairs.  There is a one to one
relationship between a device at the origin, and a device at the
destination of a communication session.  These devices must either have
shared encryption keys installed, or have some means of communicating,
in secure fashion, a data encryption key to be used for a particular
communication.

In a tymnet environment, no predefined one to one relationship need
necessarily exist between to users or applications.  Indeed, a key
element of value added services, is the flexibility provided for a
particular user, or origin, to construct circuits to multiple potential
authorized targets.  This feature, if desired, then precludes the one to
one communicating pair relationship between encryption devices noted
above.

Another issue affecting end to end encryption options, is the
protocol conversion capability offered by the network.  If network
interfaces, (which , by definition, reside between the end users,),
are to convert protocols and translate codes, they must be able
to operate on unscrambled data.  While a protocol sensitive
encryption device may encrypt only user data frames, hence retaining
the control information needed for conversion, if the network
converts data to a different protocol at the destination end,
the two encryptors cannot communicate.

The last issue affecting end to end encryption options, is one
sometimes known as Value Added Passthroughs.  These are network based
facilities which may reside on transit network processors.  They may
perform such functions as the protocol conversion noted above (such as
is provided by CMT), or may provide menu server functions, directing or
redirecting a user circuit to a different destination based upon
interaction with the user.  Use of these facilities precludes
use of end to end encryption.

While none of these challenges are insurmountable, they suggest
that for those users who wish to fully exploit the value
added features of the technology, link level encryption is
the appropriate currently available option using external
encryption devices (with the exceptions noted above).

Tymnet continues to explore alternatives for developing an
integrated encryption facility which might retain these
features while offering additional data security.
