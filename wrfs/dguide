                   ******************************
                         UPDATED 9/13/84


  I.  SITE PREP(S):
      A.  Tymnet (Dialnet) Equipment (before shipment)
          1.  Make certain a footprint has been designated and marked for
              Cabinet.
          2.  Check for power requirements.
          3.  Draw a site print showing location.

      B.  Tymnet (Dialnet) Equipment (arrival of shipment)
          1.  Verify - the packing slip with the data sheet located in the
              green folder; place packing slip in the green folder, for the
              customer.
          2.  Set up the equipment as shown in the Installation Plan Diagram/
              Micro, Mini, Vadics, Modems.  Some cabinets have been shipped
              to sites with Micro shelves located @ the top of the cabinets,
              they must go @ the bottom.
          3.  Also, check the diagram for configuration connection(s) to the
              net.  If there are any discrepancies between the Tymfiles and
              the drawings, address all connections as shown on the drawings.
          4.  Ensure that switched circuits are connected to modems to engine
              async ports sequentially, starting with lowest circuit number
              mapped to lowest port.
          5.  Ensure that the VA212PAR outdial modems are on the high-end of
              the rotary.  Use the standard 8X Octopus cable to interface 
              these modems to Telco.

      C.  Tymnet Equipment (continued)
          (a)  MINI - has battery backup, 1 meg, console
          (b)  MICRO II - 1/2 meg   (SEE TYMNET INSTALLATION NOTES)
          (c)  MICRO I  - 1/4 meg   (SEE TYMNET INSTALLATION NOTES)

      ****Ensure HS Interrupter set for 300-4800 baud access

      ****Micro odds and ends:
               1.  Special Power Plug for Console Conn.
               2.  Sync/Async Plugs for Diags.
               3.  Set Watch Dog Timer for Remote Deload
               4.  Remove Clocks - Modem will supply clocks

      D.  Diagnostics
          1.  Run diags. by linking to present site equipment
              *REFER TO IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - ACCEPTANCE TESTING
          2.  Keep a hard copy of all Diags.  Making note of date and time on
              the hardcopies.  Place in the green folder.

 II.  SITE PREP(S):
      A.  Telco Equipment Verifications:
          (Switched & DDS CKTS)
          1.  A punchblock location is to be designated for Dialog CKTS.  This
              location must be separated from any existing or future TYMNET
              CKTS.  Designate this location clear enough so Telco will have
              no doubt as to where the ckts. would be punched down.
          2.  From the punchdown block make sure the sync ckts. are run to a 
              66MB (D-MARK) block, mounted by double-sided tape in the Dialog
              Cabinet (not the Telco Cabinet). Switched circuits comprising
              RJ26X data mounting, RJ26S circuit packs & RJM4X 19" mounting
              plate should also terminate at the back of the Dialog cabinet,
              positioned according to placement of the Vadic chassis.

                                                                     PAGE 2
