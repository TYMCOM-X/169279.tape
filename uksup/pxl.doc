
PXL-I FIELD SERVICE DOCUMENT                                19 DECEMBER 1990

1.  INTRODUCTION.

1.1  OVERVIEW.

The purpose of this document  is to  outline  all  of the areas necessary to
install, configure and support the PXL harware.

This document has  nine (9)  different  sections  which are  broken down  as
follows:

Section 1, INTRODUCTION, describes the basic PXL architecture,  outlines the
remaining sections of this document and related documentation.

Section 2, CODE GENERATION, describes  the code  versions required  for  the
PXL, and a brief description of the TYMFILE changes necessary.

Section 3, CONFIGURATION GUIDELINES, describes the overall PXL configuration
guidelines (including SIO, SYNC and ASYNC).

Section 4, HARDWARE DESCRIPTIONS, describes each of the  main communications
option boards and the basic system components.

Section 5, INSTALLATION,  describes the basic PXL installation procedures.

Section 6, PART NUMEBRS,  describes all necessary PXL part numbers.

Section 7, CABLE SPECIFICATIONS, describes the PXL cables required for  each
communication option.

Section 8, LOOPBACK SPECIFICATIONS, describes the loopback options (loopback
plugs and breakouts).

Section 9, SAMPLE FILES, contains a sample ISIS TYMFILE, the commands  files
for generations the ISIS kernel and node code file, and BITS loading.


1.2  PXL ARCHITECTURE.

The  PXL is  designed to  be a phased in replacement for the PICO engine and
offers  the  same compatibility  as other members of the XL hardware family.
Because  the  MAC  V  employs  a  different  virtual  to  physical   address
translation format,  it is  NOT  compatible  with  any  previously  released
software.

Essentially  the PXL is a repackaging of the Compact XL into a significantly
smaller  package.  PXL-I has 1 megabyte of memory and communications options
equivalent  to a  single SIO motherboard, 8 standard sync ports and up to 32
standard  low speed  async ports.   The PXL utilizes  logic cell  arrays and
surface mount technology to reduce real estate and power consumption.

supporting  code be used  to accomate the expanded MAC V addressing.  In the
initial offering of the PXL the following versions of code MUST be used:

    o  NAD        version  5.00  serial number 41
    o  BITS       version  3.01  serial number 38
    o  ISIS       version 13.01
    o  NODE CODE  version  5.61
    o  XCOM       version  4.04
    o  ISCS       version 11.00 or 6.40

    o  Standalone Diagnostics:

       o  DCPU    version  4.60
       o  DMAC    version  7.60
       o  DMEM    version  4.60
       o  DSIO    version  6.60
       o  DSYA    version  5.01
       o  DSYN    version  3.00

    o  ISIS Slot Exercisers:

       o  SLSIO   version 6.00
       o  SLSYNC  version 6.00
       o  SLASYNC version 6.00
       o  SLCOPY  version 6.00


  ISIS TYMFILE ADDITIONS:

     o  MACHNS Macro   -  Machine level definition macro.  The only option
        currently implemented is MAC type.  The structure of the MACHNS
	macro is as follows:

             MACHNS(type,cpu,mac)

	     where
               type = hardware type  [DEFAULT is ENGINE]
	              (ENGINE, MINI, MICRO, TSI, PICO,HDLC,HSLCTMI)
               cpu  = CPU type (CPU2,CPU3 or CPU4)  [DEFAULT is CPU3]
	       mac  = Relocation hardware (valid only on ENGINE and MINI)
	              (MAC2, MAC3 or MAC5)   [DEFAULT is MAC2]

     o  NEWARN Equate  -  Indicates whether the Async ring device driver and
        Async connect I/O SVC is to be used.  Default value is 0  (not using
	the new async driver/SVC).  A value of enables the new Async code.
        The NEWARN equate construct is:

	    NEWARN	EQ	1	: Enable NEW ASYNC structure

     o  SLOT Macro     -  A slot level macro to specify the SLOT number.
        The SLOT macro construct is:

	    SLOT(number)

	    where number = is the the slot number

     o  DMAMAP Macro   -  A slot level  macro to  specify  the slot  DMA are
        which is relocated to low core memory.   This macro is REQUIRED only
	for slots with DMA (SIO) devices.  The DMAMAP macro construct is:

            DMAMAP(mem)

	    where mem = is the decimal value of Kmemory reserved for DMA.



  CODE GENERATION:

  In addition to the above version of code the command line for generating
  code for the PXL is the following:

      gemini%nad -v -c cmd -m cmd.log

      where
        -v          = the MAC5 switch
	-c cmd      = the name of the commands file to assemble
	-m cmd.log  = the name of the file to generate the assembly log into.
  
  


3.  CONFIGURATION GUIDELINES.

The bus slots on the PXL look like this:

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      
        |   |  |______________||______________|
	|   |         |                |
	|   |         |                |
	|   |         |                 ----------  NON-DMA expansion
	|   |          ---------------------------  DMA expansion
	|    -------------------------------------  Reserved for TTY/V.24
	 -----------------------------------------  Reserved for SIO MB


    Slot 0:  PXL-1  requires  that  slot  0  be  reserved  for  the   SIO 
             Motherboard  card.   PXL-2  will  have the  functionality of
	     the SIO motherboard  rolled down  to  the  main  motherboard
	     of the PXL.

    Slot 1:  Reserved for the SCV24 card which contains the multifunction
             logic and two (2) V.24 ports.  These  V.24 ports can be used
	     for any application (node code, X.25,  SDLC, etc).   This is
	     considered one of the 5 DMA capable slots.

    Slot 2 - Slot 5:
             Are the ONLY  DMA capable  expansion  slots.   These can run
	     any combination of OCL, V.24, V.35 or SIO ASYNC  cards.  The
	     restriction is the current SIO motherboard  guidelines.   In
	     addition, the non-SIO async cards can run in these slots.

    Slot 6 - Slot 9: 
             Are NON-DMA capable  expansion slots.   These  slots can  be
	     configured for ASYNC or a MAXIMUM of 8 sync ports.  The sync
	     ports can ONLY be configured to run in these four slots.

The rule of thumb for configurations (at this time) are as follows:

   SYNC:  Maximum of 8 ports (4 on sync primary card, 4 on sync expansion
          card).  Must be installed in  slots 6-9.   This is the standard
	  sync available on the engine.  Available at speeds up to 19.2K.
	  Maximum  sustainable SYNC  speed (aggregate CPS)  is  19200 CPS
	  (each 19.2K  line has a  value of  2400 CPS  for a  total  of 8
	  lines  at 19.2K).   The sync boards for the PXL are designed to
	  be referenced as the  NON-PRIMATIVE ports  (ports which provide
	  the full range of signals).  This is the reason for restricting
	  the  number  of  sync  ports  to 8 as  the  8  configurable are
	  defined as follows:

	      Physical port	Logical Port
	      -------- ----     ------- ----

	            0		      2
		    1                 3
		    2                 6
		    3                 7
		    4                10
		    5                11
		    6                14
		    7                15

          Therefore, the NSYNC value in the TYMFILE must be set to 16 if
	  all 8 sync ports are active.


   ASYNC: Maximum of 32 ports  (configurable as 4 per primary card, 4 per
          expansion card).  Can be installed  in ANY  slots (2-9).   This
	  is the  standard async  available on the engine.   Available at
	  300-2400 with BAUDR  set to  0 (low  speed) and  300-4800  with
	  BAUDR set to 2 (high speed).   Maximum sustainable ASYNC  speed
	  (aggregate CPS)  is  4200-4500 CPS,  no more  than  10 PC  file
          transfers simultaneously.


   SIO:   Follows CFB 168 (published SIO Configuration Guidelines):

          V.24  lines can be  any  speed up to  19200 BPS (some examples:
	  4800, 9600, 14400, 19200).   However, the configurations  below
	  treat all speeds the same!   (Example: You can NOT trade 1 19.2
	  for 2 9.6 lines.)

          SIO ASYNC lines can be run at any selectable speed (50-9600).

          Valid  configurations  are listed in order of priorities.  Pick
	  one  configuration.

	  THESE GUIDELINES ENCOMPASS  ALL SIO PORTS  (SVC24 PORTS ARE SIO
	  AND THERFORE FALL UNDER THESE GUIDELINES).

	  NO OTHER CONFIGURATIONS WILL BE SUPPORTED!

4.  HARDWARE DESCRIPTION.

4.1  BASIC SYSTEM

Chassis

The  power supply  chosen to  operate the  PXL is  an international DC power
supply which has the following characteristics:

   o  Automatic selection of AC input (90-132/175-264 VAC, 47-63 Hz)
   o  All outputs fully regulated
   o  Internal input line filter
   o  UL recognized, CSA certified
   o  80 watt power supply characteristics

SIO Port addressing.

All  daughtercards follow  the same  port address method using a 16 position
dial to set the motherboard port addressing:

    As viewed from the top down:

    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |       C                                                           |
    |     +---+                                                         |

    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

    where:

       0   =  SIO ports addressed as 0,1
       1   =  SIO ports addressed as 2,3
       2   =  SIO ports addressed as 4,5
       3   =  SIO ports addressed as 6,7
       4   =  SIO ports addressed as 8,9
       5   =  SIO ports addressed as A,B
       6   =  SIO ports addressed as C,D
       7   =  SIO ports addressed as E,F
       8-F =  SIO ports DISABLED



Stake Jumper Pin Orientation.

The  orientatation  of pin 1 on the  stake jumper can  be confusing, but a
quick check on the  soldered side of  the PCB will  reveal the location of
pin 1 by the SQUARE solder connection.



4.1.1  PXL MOTHERBOARD

The  PXL motherboard is  functionally equivalent  to the CPU III and MAC V
standard engine boards.


4.1.2  SIO MOTHERBOARD

The  PXL SIO motherboard is  functionally  equivalent  to SIO  motherboard
on a standard engine.

4.1.3  SCV24  [470359-001]

The SCV24 combines the standard engine Multifunction card with a Old Style
SIO  V.24 two (2) port  daughtercard.   

A simplified diagram of the SCV24 daughtercard is as follows:

4.2.5  SP/SE  [SP 470360-001  -  SE  470362-001]

The SP/SE PXL daughtercards are the equivalent of the standard  Engine  sync
motherboard.   The SP/SE  daughtercards provide  a  combined 8 ports of sync
access (speeds to 19.2K bps).  A MAXIMUM of  1 SP and 1 SE can be configured
and supported in a single PXL.   The SP/SE  provide  a full  set  of  RS-232
signals  (non-primative  ports)  and  therefore  the  8 ports  available are
viewed  from ISIS  as a  full 16  port sync  board (primative ports are  not
available).   The SP/SE cards can be installed in any of the PXL non-SIO bus
slots (slots 5-9) with the SP prior to the SE board.  The SP board is a full
size  daughtercard  with  the  logic  to  maintain  8  ports,  while  the SE
daughtercard  is a half-size  card with only the drivers for 4 ports.

A simplified diagram of the SP and SE  daughtercards is as follows:

 4.2.6  AP/AE   [AP  470361-001  -  AE  470365-001]

The AP/AE PXL daughtercards are the equivalent of the standard  Engine async
motherboard.   The AP/AE  daughtercards provide  a  combined 8 ports of  low
access  (300-2400  baud).    A  MAXIMUM  of  32 async ports (4 AP/AE) can be
configured on the PXL.    The AP/AE cards can be installed in any of the PXL
bus slots except slots 0 (reserved for SIO motherboard) and slot 1 (reserved
for SCV24 board).

Each  card  is a half-size  card,  with the AP daughtercard  containing  the
logic  to  maintain  8  ports,  while  the AE  daughtercard  card with  only
the drivers for 4 ports.


A simplified diagram of the async cards is as follows:



	  AP  (ASYNC  PRIMARY)             AE (ASYNC  EXTENSION)
    	         470361-001                       470365-001
