Tim,

Regarding node 2353 and your Ontyme:

I don't see any reference in PROBE during the last 6 hours that 
would point to 2353/slot 2 (Netval) in particular.  There are messages
in PROBE however that indicate that the node has been having some
overloading problems.  The Type FF message means that the node's
background processes were delayed by foreground processes.  At this
point, the number of occurrances of this message does not seem
serious.

The ?mem command in DDT will report hardware parity errors.  There
are none to report.

There does seem to be a problem with some messages given by the ?hist
command.  The messages contain some garbage and control characters, which
would indicate that the code is corrupted (if only in some stored literals).

It would probably be a good idea to schedule a network (LOADII) reload
of the machine.  This reload would replace the code stored on disk while
clearing up the garbage code problem.  Of course to do this reload of RAM
and Netval, the necessary preliminaries should be taken care of.  Since
it's hard to tell when or where corrupted code will bite you, I'd suggest
taking care of this ASAP.

Let me know how I can help.

Regards,
Skip
