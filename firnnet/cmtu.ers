


          The Sperry Univac UTS environment relies on synchronous data
          exchange between the UTS terminal and host.  The ASCII
          character set is used for that purpose.  The CMT/UTS allows
          the usage of various asynchronous terminals to communicate
          with the Univac host effectively replacing UTS terminals.

          This document contains essential information about CMT/UTS
          needed to understand all parameters that can be controlled
          by the user.  It does not however go into the innter
          workings of the interface.  Also it is assumed the reader is
          familiar with the UTS operations (if not see Sperry Univac
          Universal Terminal System 400 Programmer Reference) as well
          as with a concept of the UTS native mode (see UTS.GED).
          Since CMT/UTS interacts with the Consat interface, the
          reader is referred to CONSAT.DOC and CONSAT.ERS documents
          for more information on this subject.

          1. General Comments

          The CMT/UTS functions as a translator between selected kinds
          of terminals and a computer that addresses UTS terminals.
          The CMT/UTS converts text streams from the computer that are
          meaningful to a UTS type CRT into a text string that is
          meaningful to the selected user terminal.

          The diagram below shows how CMT/UTS connects within the net-
          work.


          [terminal]--async line--/consat/---virtual
          circuit---/CMTUTS/ ---virtual circuit---/UTS host
          int./--sync line--[univac host]

          Translation capability also provides for routing of data to
          an attached printer.

          In delivering a message from the computer the CMT/UTS will
          attempt to minimize the number of characters that must be
          delivered to the terminal.  It does this through knowledge
          of what is already on the screen and what special functions
          are available on the terminal.

          In receiving data from the terminal the CMT/UTS attempts to
          provide the same functions as a UTS terminal.  Since the
          user terminal is not likely to have the same functions as a
          UTS, much of this is done by interaction between the CMT/UTS
          and the treminal.

                                  INTRODUCTION

          The UCM (UTS CMT Operations Monitor) is a tool used to aid
          in monitoring and controlling portions of the CMTU
          interface.  Code generation may be suppressed by setting
          DEFTRC(OFF) in the Tymfile.  Access to UCM is provided by
          logging into DDT in the kernel host of the node in which
          CMTU resides.  When logging into DDT, at the prompt 'please
          log in' the user should enter:

                      USERNAME:KERNEL HOST NUMBER;PASSWORD

          followed by a carriage return.  When prompted for the slot
          number, enter the number of the slot in which CMTU resides.
          At the '*' prompt, the ?STAT command will put the user into
          UCM.  The prompt (:>) indicates that the UCM is ready to
          accept commands.

          Command lines are terminated by a carriage return and the
          arguments are separated from the command and from each other
          by a space.  A few editing control functions are available.

          An ESCAPE aborts the current command line and returns to the
          prompt (:>).
          A control W (^W) discards the partial token already input.
          A control A (^A) or control H (^H) discards the last
          character.
          A control C (^C)terminates current processing in UCM and
          returns the user to DDT.

          The date is displayed in the format ddmmyy, where dd is the
          day, mm is the month, and yy is the year.

          The command argument NAME, refers to the 8 characters of the
          username that was used to login to the CMTU slot.  PORT
          refers to the TERMINAL port number assigned to that user.
          This references a unique user logged on to the CMTU slot.

                      SECTION 3. TERMINAL-USER INTERACTION



          CMT/UTS interacts with the user and the user's terminal in
          several ways in order to provide the functions of a UTS
          terminal.  Which keys on the terminal perform wich UTS
          functions is dependent upon parameters that are unique to
          each installation.  Each installation may elect to assign a
          different terminal key or series of keys to a function.

          Certain functions are performed  remotely  by  the  CMT/UTS.
          This may result in some delay before a character typed at
          the terminal affects the screen.  Characters may temporarily
          appear in the wrong place.  When this occurs a short pause
          by the operator will result in the screen being restored and
          the misplaced characters being moved to their correct
          positions.  This pause is necessary only if the operator
          must visually verify the contents of the screen.  Otherwise
          the operator can simply continue typing and the CMT/UTS will
          catch-up very quickly.

          The delay occurs because echoing is sometimes performed
          remotely by the CMT/UTS.  This results in a delay which is a
          function of distance and traffic in the network.  The
          CMT/UTS allows local echoing by the Tymsat when possible.
          Because of network delay there may be a short period before
          this can be shut off when Tymsat echoing is not appropriate.
          This results in echoing into the wrong place.  This is
          detected and the damage is repaired.  Ordinarily this
          happens very quickly and can be comfortably ignored once it
          becomes familiar.

          There is a fundamental trade off between remote echo delay
          and the ability to reduce to a minimum the number of
          characters sent over the network.  This reduction is done by
          the CMTU to avoid sending redundant data to the terminal.
          Since the CMTU is a stand-alone slot, in order to get the
          full advantage of the savings it should be positioned closer
          to the host interface but further from the Consat.  However,
          the extra distance from the Consat makes remote echoing
          slower.

          The UTS terminal has a number of special functions that have
          immediate effects on the screen or cause transmission to the
          computer.  They are all described in the Sperry Univac

          Universal Terminal manual.  The actual keys used to
          implement these functions depend on the installation and the
          terminal type.  There are however three important additional
          functions that do not exist on Univac terminals.  They are:
          ZAP, ZAP HOST and REDISPLAY.

          Upon striking CONTROL Z (irrespective of the terminal type
          both circuits are zapped and the user is returned to 'please
          log in:'.  It is recommended that the uerform a host
          logoff to terminate the current session before invoking this
          function.

          Upon striking CONTROL Y (irrespective of the terminal type)
          only the host circuit is zapped and the user remains
          connected to the CMT.  The menu screen appears to let the
          user select another destination host, or because of the menu
          bypass feature (see section 3.2.5) if there is only a single
          destination host logon will follow immediately.  It is
          recommended that the user perform a host logoff to terminate
          the current session before invoking this function.

          The redisplay function clears the screen and redisplays its
          current screen buffer.  This is useful, for example, when a
          message sent from outside the application appears on the
          screen and overwrites data.  REDISPLAY would return the
          screen to its original form.  Also one may want to use it
          whenever it is feared the terminal screen does not match the
          screen buffer contents.  This may occur - for example - when
          because of very fast typing and echo delay some damage has
          been done on the screen and logic that normally should fix
          it fails for some reason.  This function was first put in to
          serve as a debugging tool in the process of software
          developemnt.  Also, on some terminal types (e.g. VT100) the
          line feed function may cause the undesirable scrolling of
          the whole screen when the cursor is at the bottom line.  In
          such cases the line feed key is mapped into the REDSIPLAY
          function.  This alleviates the problem of scrolling since
          the screen is erased anyway.

          A stored logon mechanism is provided in the CMT/UTS.  Upon
          logon to the CMT/UTS, the user is presented with a menu
          screen (see section 4.2)

          The menu screen displays a list of short (one line) des-
          criptions of possible destinations.  The user then positions
          the cursor next to the desired line and strikes the XMIT
          key.  All necessary logon operations are performed
          automatically.  In the event of a failure, a brief error
          text would be displayed and the user presented with the
          option to either zap the circuit or bring back the menu
          screen for another selection.


          The CMT/UTS streamlines the signon process by minimizing the
          number of screens the user must view.  The menu bypass
          function does this in two ways.  If there is only one
          terminal type in the terminal selection screen, then this
          screen is bypassed.  The user does not have to make a
          selection when there is only one item in the list.
          Similarly if there is only one host in the host selection
          menu, then this screen is also bypassed.  The host selection
          is done automatically by the CMT/UTS.


          When the keyboard-locked condition is present, no data may
          be input.  The keyboard may or may not be physically locked,
          depending on the terminal type; but the CMTU will reject all
          characters received during the locked condition.

          Typing may resume as soon as the keyboard gets unlocked
          which occurs when the user unlocks it or, more often, when
          the host sends a data message without the 'keyboard lock'
          command.  The primary reason for the host to lock the
          keyboard is to prevent the user from typing when there is
          more data pending to be sent by the host.

          If printer support is available, then the only criteria for
          required printer is a printer that supports form fields,
          line feed, carriage return, and sufficient columns for the
          specific application.  The printer should be connected
          directly (straight cable) to the auxiliary port of the
          terminal, which should be correctly set up as specified in
          the terminal manual (DNDSPEC) CMTERM.ERS.  This document was
          originally written for CMT/3270, nevertheless the bulk of
          the information enclosed applies to the CMT/UTS environment
          as well.

          Certain terminal types do not support a printer.  Check each
          terminal description to see which ones do.

          Note that even though CMTU supports only 80-column screens,
          it can support 132-column print applications.  The
          requirement is that the printer can support 132 columns and
          has been set up correctly.  There need be no changes to CMTU
          for 132 versus 80 column wide printing.

          The data characters acturally sent to the printer by CMTU
          are determined by the field definition and the initiation
          command been used. If printer handling improvement is
          enabled (OPTION(TRANSP,YES), see section 4.3.7.1), CMTU will
          direct data to the printer in different ways depending on
          the initiation command sent by the host application:

          1.  Initiation command = Print (DC2). CMTU sends the data to
              the screen and 'print screen sequence' at the end which
              will print the screen image on the printer.

          2.  Initiation command = Transparent Print (ESC DC2). CMTU
              sends data directly to the printer without displaying it
              on the screen. This is different from what the native
              mode calls for; which is sending the data first to the
              screen and then to the printer. In other words, after
              printer operation is completed, the terminal_buffer in
              CMTU is updated with the last message sent by the host
              while the physical screen remains the same as the screen
              before printing. Therefore, in order for user to see it
              he should type 'REDISPLAY'.

          When printer improvement is disabled, CMTU will send data to
          the screen followed by printer formatted data to the printer
          according to the initiation command received. Currently,
          CMTU supports printer improvement function for VT100
          terminal only.

          No keyboard input is allowed during printer operation. At
          the end of the print operation, the keyboard is unlocked.

          CMT requires certain terminal settings for the compatibility
          of the terminal-Consat connection.  The tables below lists
          all of them together with others that are optional.  How the
          actual selection of these settings is performed depends on
          the terminal type and the appropriate terminal manual should
          be referred to.

          Disabled parity check, 8 bit character length and proper
          set-up for XON/XOFF are the most important items in the
          table.  Also, whenever possible, auto-wrap/scroll/feed
          functions should be turned off.  This should be done to
          match terminal-characteristic information contained in the
          terminal type macro (see section 4.2.7).  Having those
          functions off enables CMT to have scrolling under its
          control.  In cases where they cannot be turned off at set-up
          there is usually a way to prevent a terminal from
          inadvertently scrolling by issuing a proper command from the
          CMT (see section 3.2.8).

          A right_justified field is defined to allow the user to
          enter data from right side of the field. The right_justified
          function works only when the cursor is located in the first
          (left_most) position of the field. While tying, the cursor
          remains in the first position, each new character appears in
          the right_most position while shifting the characters in the
          field to the left one position. If the field is full, the
          cursor moves to the next unprotected position.

          To make corrections in a right justified field, the cursor
          should be moved to the position of the character to be
          corrected. After making correction, the cursor moves to the
          next position or stays in the same position if the character
          corrected is in the last position of the field. The user is
          prohibited from entering a character which precedes the
          right justified characters in a partially filled field
          except the first position of the field.

          There is one case, where the user cannot correct a character
          in the right justified field. This happens when the user
          tries to correct the first character in a field which is
          already full. In this case, the only way to make the
          correction is to erase the entire field and reenter the
          data.

                             SECTION 4. THE TYMFILE



          The Tymfile is used as a configuration file for the CMT/UTS
          interface.  There is only one global level macro necessary
          to define the configuration, the DEFHST macro.  There is an
          optional DEFHDR macro, which defines a heading line for the
          menus.  In addition to these two macros, there are several
          macros needed to define the menus.

          A few general comments:

          1.  All alphanumeric and control characters have equates for
              their ASCII to ASCII representations, so that
              hexadecimal values or the equated symbols for the
              characters can be used interchangeably throughout the
              Tymfile.

          2.  All elements, logon strings, and menus are defined with
              a label as the first parameter.  This label is formed
              following standard assembler conventions.  The label is
              then used in all references to the element, string, or
              menu in the Tymfile.

          3.  The maximum number of simultaneous users for the CMT/UTS
              is limited by memory requirements and CPU load.  Memory
              requirements are in one of the following sections.  The
              CPU load estimate is one transaction per seconds.
              Because of the nature of the optimization process, the
              CPU load will become more of a factor that the memory
              size as a configuration grows.

          4.  The command may be included in the text of strings like
              the DEFHDR macro string but it must be preceded by a
              BACKQUOTE.  This is necessary to distinguish between the
              comma as text and the comma as separating two operands
              in a macro.

          The DEFHST macro defines the host number and the number of
          users for an interface.  The number of users is the number
          of simultaneous users allowed on the interface.  The format
          of the macro is;

          The DEFHDR macro defines a heading line to be printed at the
          top of the CRT screen as a heading to the menu.  Up to 76
          characters of text are allowed.  Note that commas may be
          included in the text but that they must be preceded by a
          left quote.

          Logging into a UTS host via the CMT/UTS is accomplished with
          either a stored logon definition or choosing the Manual
          logon option from the MENU.  The sequence of required
          information for logon is stored in memory and the login,
          once initiated, is accomplished without user intervention.

          In order to utilize the stored logon mode, various macros
          have been defined to create the stored logon strings during
          assembly time.  Thus, at the beginning of a session, the
          user is confronted with a menu of logon strings and selects
          the particular one to reach the desired host.  This
          selection is accomplished by positioning the cursor to the
          left of the text describing the desired logon string, and
          striking XMIT.

          ELEMENT - is the basic part of a logon string.  It consists
          of all the characters required for either a network logon to
          a UTS host, or the DSP information for that logon, as
          follows:

          1.  Network logon - composed of a label followed by the
               logon user username, optional host number, and optional
               password.

          2.  DSP information - composed of a label followed by
               requested destination RID and SID addresses.

          LOGON STRING - is one of the items in a menu for selection.
          It consists of two elements (net logon and DSP information)
          that lead to the desired destination host.  It is composed
          of a label, followed by text describing the destination
          host, followed by references to the elements that make up
          this string.

          MENU - is the screen of choices for the user to select.  It
          consists of the label for this menu, followed by an ordered
          sequence of logon strings, each referenced by their label.


          The stored logon processing does not require that the
          password for the network logon be stored also.  If this
          operand is missing from the Tymfile, then the CMT/UTS will
          prompt the user for the password.  This gives additional
          flexibility for the customer desiring a greater degree of
          password protection - i.e. those customers who desire to
          change their passwords often can do so without reloading
          their CMT/UTS slot.

          The DEFELE(label,element) macro defines an element in some
          logon string and a label to reference it by.  This macro
          should precede all other macro calls for stored logon.  The
          maximum number of elements is determined by available space
          in practice, but is 2**16 in theory.  Each element may not
          exceed 255 characters.

          The DEFUSR(username) macro defines a username that is valid

          of all referenced elements, strings, and menus; it should
          precede the definition of the default terminal type (DEFTTY)
          and the menu (MENUSR) for this user.  The first 8 characters
          are checked and must match exactly unless a wildcard
          character ("00) is specified.  For example, if the username

          The DEFTTY(relative) macro defines the default terminal type

          types are defined in the DEFTRM macro (see below).  A value
          of -1 in the DEFTTY macro will cause the select terminal
          type screen to be displayed.  The list of valid terminal

          RID, SID and DID can be defined in the Tymfile for the
          purpose of initial call set up to the host interface (they
          are equivalent to RID, SID and DID identifying every station
          in the UTS Native Mode, and entered into a Univac terminal
          through the control page).  However, due to non-native mode
          environment where there is no polling these parameters are
          of no importance besides the original call set-up (they are
          used at calling address packet).  They are predefined in I-
          file with arbitrary values and there seems to be to be no
          need to ever redefine them.

          Setting up the transmit mode is equivalent to the same

          NBFLET will define the total number of bufferlets for the
          slot.  This bufferlet pool will be divided between the users
          and is used for storing characters when CMT/UTS cannot
          process them for any reason.  For example if CMT/UTS is
          processing a long message from the host and a second message
          came in before the optimizer finished with the first one, it
          is possible that some of the data would be buffered.

          Another likely situation for buffering is for customers with
          a broadcast-type application.  This is where the host
          computer sends messages to a number of terminals without
          being specifically requested to do so by each terminal.  One
          example of this might be unsolicited messages being sent to
          all printers in a system.  Another example might be a stock
          quote application, that would periodically update a set of
          terminals.  Broadcast applications could easily overflow the

          standard allocation of bufferlets.  In this case a larger
          number of bufferlets would be required.  The current formula
          in the I-file for the total number of bufferlets should be
          sufficient for normal operation even with a printer.

          NSCRN represents the number of screen buffers assigned to
          the interface.  Because of the optimization process which
          compares the old screen with the new one to avoid sending
          duplicate characters to the terminal it will require more
          than one screen buffer per user.  If too few buffers are
          originally selected there may be a danger of running out of
          them during the program execution.  If this ever happens a
          user will be disconnected with a relevant message appearing
          on his terminal screen.  This may happen without any prior
          warning as buffers are being 'captured' and 'released'
          dynamically depending on the current need for screen memory,
          which again depends on the number of users logged on and the
          level of their activities at any particular moment.
          Assigning too many screen buffers may be expensive in memory
          (see section 4.5).  If there is no definition of NSCRN
          within the Tymfile, a default value will be chosen.
          Currently, the following formula is being used for this
          purpose:
                   NSCRN = 2+(num of users)+(num of users)/6

          It should be stressed that running a host interface with the
          Early Data Forwarding or Data Segmentation mode normally
          requires slightly more screen buffers.  The above formula
          assumes this operation mode and takes it into account.

          The function key default assignment table is a macro that
          consists of numerous LEVELn statements.  Each LEVELn
          statement defines a single key stroke that is typed to
          invoke a UTS function.  LEVEL1 is the first key stroke of
          the sequence.  Likewise LEVEL2, LEVEL3, LEVEL4 and LEVEL5
          define the seconds, the third, the fourth and the fifth key
          strokes if they exist.  The LEVELn statement has either 2 or
          3 parameters.  The first parameter is a pneumonic for the
          character to be typed.  For example, A.I is an ASCII 'I'.
          The second parameter is either 0 or 1.  A '0' indicates that
          an additional key stroke (LEVELn) is needed for the function
          being defined.  No third parameter is present.  A '1'
          indicates this is the last key stroke (LEVELn) of the
          function.  A third parameter must follow.  The third
          parameter is the name of the function that is being defined.
          For example:

                  LEVEL1(A.BS,1,BACKSP :CONTROL H IS BACKSPACE

          The above defines a single key stroke sequence used to
          invoke BACKSP function or

          HOME function.

          Complete keyboard default assignment tables for all
          supported terminals are in section 5.  If there are any
          desired changes the following procedure should be followed.
          A copy of the function key default assignment table should
          be included at the end of the T0x file.  Edit the desired
          changes into this copy.  NAD must be instructed to ignore
          the copy that is in the initialization file.  This is
          accomplished via a KILL 'macroname' assembler directive that
          must precede the table.  When the interface is assembled,
          the changes you have made in the table will take effect.  At
          present the following terminal types and their associtated
          keyboard function tables are defined in the initialization
          file:

          The above set of macros included after the DEFTRM macro in

          VT100 after re-assembling the interface.  Nevertheless,
          there should be no attempt to change the assignments of
          three key sequences, namely: CONTROL Z, CONTROL Y and CONTRL
          U.  They are used to implement ZAP, ZAP HOST and UNLOCK
          KEYBRD respectively.  Currently these three can NOT be

          The amount of memory required for the CMT/UTS can be readily

          NCSRN - number of screen buffers (see section 4.3.6)
          FCCSIZ - size of the FCC storage area per screen
                   (must be defined in INIT file)

          FCCSIZ represents the UTS graphic attributes storage area.
          It will grow larger when more FCC's per screen must be
          sysgened.  If a user can estimate in advance the maximum
          number of FCC's a substantial amount of memory may be saved.
          FCCSIZ is derived by the following equation:

          
FCCSIZ = 4 * (num of FCC's per screen)/1000

          Currently the number of FCCs is fixed at 384 (16 per screen
          line).  Combining this value with the current algorithm for
          NSCRN one can obtain a more direct formula for the total
          required CMT/UTS memory in the present configuration:

                -----------------------------------------------
                |MEMORY(dec. K-bytes) = 50 + 9*(num of users) |
                -----------------------------------------------

          This formula assmes one terminal type and is accurate within
          5%.  For every additional terminal type 1-K of extra memory
          should be allowed.

             SECTION 5. KEYBOARD MAP TABLES FOR SUPPORTED TERMINALS



          The following tables show default keyboard mapping of
          various UTS functions for all supported terminal types.  The
          left column lists major UTS keyboard functions and columns
          to the right depict what keys must be pressed on a given
          terminal to invoke those functions.  In some cases a
          terminal has a key which closely resembles a UTS key; such a
          similarity will be preserved whenever possible.  If not
          possible, or a similar key does not exist a unique control
          sequence is selected.  If another mapping is desired, the
          procedure to follow is described in section 3.4.

               F    means CONTROL F (upper/lower case irrelevant)
              (s)   means press shift key
