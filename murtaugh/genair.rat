                      --------- ------- --- -------

        The following is a precis of recommendations obtained through
a survey taken of VANCF line personnel as pertaining to anticipated
editing of the GENERIC SOP.  These recommendations fall into two 
catagories ( alterations and additions) and are addressed accordingly.


  I. Suggested Alterations:
     --------- -----------
     A.  Due to changes/upgrades in network software, the COUNT command 
         (page 40, section I) is no longer available in all systems.
         The STAT command is now used in VANET.
     
     B.  Whenever possible, the use of the G 5A command in DDT should
         be used rather than DLOAD command in PROBE (pages 58 & 59).
         This command is preferable in ISIS nodes due to the fact that
         the node will be forced to run bootstrap routine.  Unlike the
         DLOAD command of PROBE, which relies on the position of the
         watchdog timer switch.

     C.  Regarding the manual method of forcing a node to boot, the
         use of the watchdog timer switch (up position for 10 seconds,
         then bottom position) to enable automatic reboot should be 
         included.

     D.  Three line personnel mentioned the fact that the "Node Failure    
         and Recovery" section on page 40 does not include that the
         circuit link to network via Dataphone Controller might be responsible
         for node outage/recovery and should, when present, be utilized to
         investigate the outage.

     E.  "Gateway Failure and Recovery" section should be substituted
         with the VANCF SOP procedure.

     F.  The reference to Ontyming FE's on page 54 has been made obsolete
         by use of CHAD system and practice of reporting trouble to Central
         Dispatch.


 II. Suggested Additions:
     --------- ---------

     A. Due to our ever increasing reliance on them, the addition of a 
        procedure reflecting the proper use of PC's in a network operations
        environment is needed.  Since many or our first line technicians
        have limited experience with PC operations, a explicit list of
        Do's and Don'ts should be included in this procedure:
        
        1. Do's
           
           a. CRT and keyboard should be kept clean at all times.
           b. All files in personal directories should be kept as brief
              and revelant as possible to assure optimum use of disk space.
           c. As with the use of PDP 10's, respect for the directories and
              files of others should be stressed.
           d. Notification of responsible person (programmer, coordinator,
              supervisor, or manager) of any planned changes to the PC
              environment before they are made.




                                    (2)


**         e. When utilized, one should limit use of PC to the menu system
              of operations. This menu system is especially recommended
              for use in situations where line personnel have little or no
              experience in using PC's.

        2. Don'ts

           a. Storage of and use of PC game software must be warned against.
           b. Utilization of PC's to gain access to public bulletin board
              systems should be carefully limited.  Though there are many
              free bulletin board systems which offer useful public domain
              software, use of PC's to access these should be carefully
              controlled so as to monitor proper use of disk space.
**         c. For ethical and legal reasons, it should be stressed that
              no marketed software be stored or installed on PC's without
              prior purchase by the business unit.     
             
     B.  The use of LOD on reload systems should be included in the SOP
         since the implamentation of the LODSTRG program in all networks.

     C.  Due to the development of HDLC micro computers, the use of the
         manual boot switch needs to be addressed.         

     D.  A procedure explaining the proper file transfer methods between
         PC/Host, Host/PC, PC/Ontyme, and Ontyme/PC is needed.  Suggest
         including NSSC Procdure addressing this issue.


III. Summary:
     -------
     Due to differences in structure between the Public Net and the VA
Net, there were some factors which caused confussion during our survey. 
Primarily, these factors involved use of a utility none of VANCF's line
personnel have had occassion to use.  The ELF utility is not presently
used in the VA Net and, therfore, was viewed as not needed.  In addition,
many of the sites in the VA Net are not manned 24 hours a day.  This
factor caused some differences in troubleshooting methodology.
     One further question needs to be addressed. Copies of the documentation
pakage for LODSTRG and AUTOLOAD have been attached. How best should the
use of these programs (as well as TYMWATCH) be addressed in the updated
SOP.  Should each be covered by a seperate procdure, should all applications
programs be covered by one procedure referencing users to apporpriate
documentation, or should they simply be omitted??





















                                LODSTRG
                                -------

                        I.  Operations Requirements
                       II.  Software Capabilities
                      III.  Software Operations
                       IV.  File Descriptors

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



        I.    This program requires use of an IBM (PC/XT/AT) or IBM compatible,
        attached printer, hard disk (internal/external), and one synchronous
        communications port. Program produces data files upon which other
        programs rely to execute. It is therefore necessary to run LODSTRG
        before attempting to run AUTOLOAD.

              Due to complexity of program and use of communications
        port/buffer, attention must be paid to system operating environ-
        ment.  Consult your operations manual for communications
        configuration requirements.



        II.  PROGRAM CAPABILITIES:

             LODSTRG- is a program designed to log on to XRAY of each node
        in a network and extract a listing of load strings.  These
        listings are then sorted and written to file (file suffix = .SRT).
        This sorted file can then be printed to hard copy or transferred
        to a PDP10 for access by LOD data search program.  File transfer
        to PDP10 is accomplished by use of TYMCOMM communications program
        on IBM and COPYPC on PDP10.

             Approximate operating time = 30 to 50 minutes for 340 node
                                          network

        III. PROGRAM OPERATION:

             A. Type LOD at system prompt.
             B. When asked if NODE LIST update is needed, answer <N>
                if updated recently. Use this procedure only if additions
                to or deletions from network structure have occured
                since file was built/updated.
             C. Enter XRAY user name and password of selected network
                as prompted. Enter Network code (two letters) as
                prompted.
             D. Select <R> option from menu.
             E. Program will produce audible tone on each Xray
                logoff. No tone = Program Halted. In this case, it is
                best to restart program.
                1. Depress <Ctrl> + <Break>
                2. Type CLOSE and depress <Return>
                3. Type CLEAR and depress <Return>
                4. Type RESET and depress <Retrun>
                5. Type RUN and depress <Return>
                6. You may select start at node option to continue run
                   and reduce run time.
             F. After program completion, Program Submenu will appear.
                Select T (file transfer) option. This option will
                automatically give you access to TRANSFER ( a customized
                TYMCOMM terminal communications file).
             G. Utilize TRANSFER to logon primary code system as
                prompted. File transfer will be automatic until prompted
                for secondary system number and directory. After TRANSFER
                is complete, you will be returned to MENU.
             H. Select E (exit to Main Menu) from program submenu to
                exit.

         IV. FILE DESCRIPTORS:

             A. LODSTRG.DOC = this documentation file
             B. LODSTRG.BIN = binary source code for NODLOAD
             C. LOD.EXE     = machine level executable file
             D. TRANSFER    = customized version TYMCOMM for file
                transfers
             E. PROC2.TYM   = procedures file for TRANSFER ... this
                file must accompany TRANSFER.


             **NOTE**  NOD file is required by AUTOLOAD and LOD program on
                       PDP10's needs the SRT file produced by LODSTRG.

         ================================================================

             **NOTE** LOD is a TBA program (NCF directory, sys 26/31)
             designed to access database of valid load$'s resulting from
             file transfer procedure. Once copied onto appropriate
             systems, it is activated with the GO LOD command.
             Enter tagret NODE # and LOD will produce a listing of said
             load$'s.








                                AUTOLOAD
                                --------

*******************************************************************************



                                CONTENTS
                                --------


                        I.  Operations Requirements
                       II.  Software Capabilities/Limitations
                      III.  Software Initiation
                       IV.  File Descriptors

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



        I.    This program requires use of an IBM (PC/XT/AT) or IBM
        compatible, attached printer, hard disk (internal/external), and
        one synchronous communications port. The program also depends upon
   *    a data file produced by LODSTRG. Please be sure LODSTRG has been run
        recently before attempting to run AUTOLOAD. In addition, AUTOLOAD
  **    utilizes MUX capabilites for multiple virtual circuit construction.
        It is therefore necessary to assign a valid MUX user id and
        password to the program during intialization.


        II.  PROGRAM EXPLICATION:

             AUTOLOAD- is a compiled program designed to monitor PROBE for
       Node outages. AUTOLOAD takes immediate remedial/diagnostic
       action (UPCOMING:opens trouble tickets in the event of said outages).

             While AUTOLOAD is activated, all program activity is
       monitored by the screen and documented on printed hardcopy.
       The user is informed of all program activity (attempted CDUMPS,
       crash code analysis, attempted reloads, and prompts for follow
       up actions required by user) through hardcopy produced on the
       on line printer. Although it is not necessary for personnel to
       attempt manual reloads, it is necessary to periodically monitor
       program output and take appropriate action as directed.

             When a node outage is detected, AUTOLOAD:

       1. waits the time specified by user at program intialization

 ***   2. searches NET.NOD to obtain valid load strings

       3. interacts with the PDP10 system specified by the user to attempt
          a CDUMP on the down node

       4. utilizes NAD to analize the crash dump








                                 (2)


       5. attempts to reload production code through use of LOADII
          on the specified system

       6. (VERSION 6.0) and, finally, interacts with another PDP10 to open a
          trouble ticket on the down node.

       (Ticket header information is obtained from a datasearch of
       archive tickets)


             During these operations, an arrowhead display will "travel"
       the top of screen to indicate program activity. When program is
       involved in a background task (i.e. cdumps, reloads, tkt opening,
       or data searches) this arrowhead indicator will stop. However, the
       PROBE monitoring prompt should flash. If this indicator is not
       present, utilize function key F1 to unhang. In addition, F2 may be
       used to enter a node # for addition to AUTOLOAD's file of down
       nodes (very useful for scheduled reloads), and F3 may be used to
       toggle on/off CDUMP routine whithout terminating program execution.


        III. PROGRAM INITIATION:

             A. Copy ALOAD.EXE onto your IBM or compatible.

             B. At system prompt, type <ALOAD> and enter.

             C. Warning .. LODSTRG must be run prior to ALOAD. After initial
                run, LODSTRG need only be run after additions to or deletions
                from network structure.

             D. When asked if CDUMP option should be bypassed, answer <Y>
                only if ALOAD is being used for scheduled reloads.
             ** Bypass of CDUMP will deactivate TICKET option on Ver. 6.0**

             E. Program will produce audible tone on each Node outage
                No tone on outage= Program Halted. In this case, it is
                best to restart program.
                1. Depress F4 ... if ineffective <Ctrl> + <Alt> + <Del>
                2. At system prompt, type <ALOAD> and enter

       ------------------------------------------------------------------
             ********
             **NOTE** Care should be taken that gateway is preserved.
             ******** If gateway is lost, halt program and restart using
             procedures outlined above.
       ------------------------------------------------------------------

         IV. FILE DESCRIPTORS

             *  LODSTRG- an accompanying program that utilizes XRAY
                to create a file of currently valid load strings for
                all network nodes.

            **  MUX- utilization of multiplexer is necessary for AUTOLOAD
                to build its needed circuits to appropriate systems and
                PROBE.

           ***  NET.NOD- LODSTRG produced file of valid load strings
                needed for AUTOLOAD to perform its duties.




          ALOAD.EXE  >>> compiled version of AUTOLOAD
