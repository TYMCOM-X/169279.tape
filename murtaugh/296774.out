     REPORT SENT YET ?: YES
The way the customer is trying to bring up NETVAL by useing tapes created on    
they're VAL machine will not work due to the fact that the tapes are written    
in two completely different formats. The customer will have to use the VAL to   
NETVAL conversion sequence specified in the NETVAL operations manual. Steve
