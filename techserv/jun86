   TYMNET COUNTERPARTS FROM RAW ACCTING DATA FOR "PPSN GENERIC REQUIREMENTS"
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------


Written by : Shirley Chiang, Mgr. HQ Application's Support
      Date : May 14, 1986




      A total of 55 fields are identified from Bell Corp.'s "PPSN Generic
   Requirements - TA 00301" Appendix A, page A1 through A27.

      The purpose of this document is to provide the Tymnet counterparts,
   from the raw accounting data, for these 55 items.




 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


 1.  Call Type

     PVC indicator is used in X.25 but currently not being reported to
     Supervisor's accounting.  Latest news says it will be reported in
     version 3.02 of X.25 scheduled to be released in July, 86.

     PVC indicator is in Msg. type 14.15.00.ff, where ff=0001 as a flag.

 2.  Sensor Type

     We are not sure of the definition and therefore unable to give answers
     unless more explanations are provided.

     From here on, this type of situation will be marked as D.N.C. for
     Definition Not Clear.

 3.  Sensor Id.

     D.N.C.

 4.  Recording Office Type

     D.N.C.

 5.  Recording Office Id.

     D.N.C.

 6.  Connect Date

     (If this means the start date/time of a network login session:)

     = timestamp (GMT from 01/01/74 in seconds) on the block where Msg. 
       type 01 for a session is recorded.  The timestamp can be converted
       to create the standard MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS format.

 7.  Timing Indicator

     Not directly reflected in raw accounting data.  May be obtained by
     analysing the start/termination time explained in Item #16 and 17.

 8.  Study Indicator

     N/A. (Not Applicable in Tymnet Accounting)

 9.  Originating Sensor Id.
   
     D.N.C.

10.  Terminating Sensor Id.

     D.N.C.

11.  Originating SR (service region)

     Tymnet Accounting provides the the node/host information of the origi-
     nation/destination point into/out the Network.  It does not capture
     the phone numbers of the private or public dial-up accesses unless:

      A.  if the dial-up number is entered after the password (in the login
          string) and treated as part of the project code, then it will
          be recorded in multiple Msg. type 13's;

      B.  in order for the project code to be reported, the destination host
          or host interface must do something special.  It must turn a flag
          on in ISIS segment "E", so the destination node will capture
          everything entered after the password up to 27 characters
          and ship it to the supervisor as accounting Msg. type 13's.
          Usually this is handled as a patch which may be incorperated
          or assembled into the code when project code is desired.  Con-
          sultation with Tymnet technical support shall be needed in search
          of such a patch for various interfaces.

     Orig. node is in Msg. type 2, bit 4 - 15,
     orig. host is in Msg. type 4.2, bit 16 -31,
     dest. node is in Msg. type 4.1, bit 16 -31,
     dest. host is in Msg. type 3, bit 12 - 20.

12.  Originating SA-EPN (service area-end point number)

     See Item #11.

13.  Terminating SR

     See Item #11.

14.  Terminating SA-EPN

     See Item #11.

15.  Network User Id.

     A. If this means the unique Tymnet invoice or session number:
   
        = Msg. type 01, bit 8 - 31, where bit 8 - 11 is prefixed by 
          Supervisor number as each Supervisor keeps its own set
          of numbers up to 20 bits long to assign to every logon session.
          In order to make the invoice/session number unique, the Supervisor
          number is then prefixed to the 20 bit sequential numbers.

     B.  If this means the user name:

        = multiple Msg. type 4.0, where each Msg. type 4.0 contains up to
          three characters of the user name string.

     C.  If this means the NUI in X.25:

        NUI will be part of the calling/called address and is dependent
        on how it is structured and specified in X.25.
        (Reference Tymnet X.25/X.75 Reference Manual, Chapter 2)
        (Also see Item #31, 32 for detail on calling/called address)

16.  Connect Time

     See item #6.

17.  Elapsed Time

     If this means the session duration time:

     = (termination GMT) - (start GMT), where termination GMT is the timestamp
     of the block when the last accounting message (could be type 9, 10, 11
     or 14) is recorded for the session.

     In Tymnet's own billing process, program will flag if the termination
     indicator (Msg. type 14) is received.  Otherwise, it will hold the
     last accounting message (for the session) for six hours as a graceful
     waiting period, and then uses the timestamp of that last accounting
     message as the termination time and artificially generates a termination
     code of 84.

18.  Charging & Packet Indicator

     Definition not clear for Packet Indicator.

     Charging Indicator as used in X.25:

     = Msg. type 14.0.7.nm, where nm is a two byte field,
       n = 0 for normal charge (i.e. charge to orig. DTE),
         = 1 for reverse charge (i.e. charge to terminating DTE),
       m = 0 for originating from host or FEP
         = 1 for originating from terminal or PAD.

       (X.25 defaults to reverse charge.)

19.  Termination Cause Indicator

     = Msg. type 10, 11 or 12, and/or msg. type 14.0.0.vv where
       vv is a 16 bit value ranging from 1 to 32 and providing
       a supplement to the termination reasons indicated in Msg.
       10, 11 or 12.

       Occasionally Msg. type 14.0.15.nm may be sent by X.25/X.75 as
       an additional supplement for more detailed termination causes,
       where n = call clear cause,
             m = diagonostic code.

20.  Rate Period 1 Segment Count

     Segment count or packet count is reported by X.25/X.75:

     = Msg. type 14.1 through 14.8.  May be reported by both the orig. 
       and destination interfaces.

     Tymnet internal billing normally uses orig. p/s count.  If orig.
     p/s count is not presented, then destination p/s count will be used.

     Rate period can be obtained by comparing the session elapsed time.

21.  Rate Period 2 Segment Count

     See Item #20.

22.  Rate Period 3 Segment Count

     See Item #20.

23.  Rate Period 4 Segment Count

     See Item #20.

24.  Originating Service Type

     Not directly reflected in raw accounting data.  Must read the orig.
     node/host and match with some kind of external table (of SWB's)
     to identify the type of service or application running within
     the origination point or terminal interface.

     Orig. node is in Msg. type 2, bit 4 - 15,
     orig. host is in Msg. type 4.2, bit 16 - 31.

25.  Terminating Service Type

     Similar process needed to identify the termination host or host
     interface.

     Termination or destination node is in Msg. type 4.1, bit 16 - 31,
     termination or destination host is in Msg. type 3, bit 12 - 20.

26.  Priority

     N/A.

27.  Segment Size

     If this means the segments generated by X.25 interface:

     not recorded in raw accounting data.  It is dynamically calcu-
     lated by X.25, some segments may carry more data, some less.
     In general, guess-timated average is around 22 characters per segment.

28.  Fast Select

     Only applicable in X.25/X.75.

     = Msg. type 14.15.1.  But this is not being reported by X.25/X.75.
     Version 3.02 of X.25 will report this information as accounting
     addendum to the Supervisor.  Version 3.02 is scheduled to be released
     in July, 86.

     When it is implemented, this message will be reported only when
     Fast Select is requested;otherwise, no such message will even be
     seen in the raw accounting data.

29.  Present Date

     Generated by SWB.

30.  Present Time
  
     Generated by SWB.

31.  Originating DNIC

     = Msg. type 14.10 through 14.13, calling DTE address reported by
     X.25/X.75.  The first 4 BCD digits are the originating DNIC,
     followed by another 10 digits for supplementary network id 
     which is determined by X.25 parameter structures.

32.  Terminating DNIC

     Same as Item #31,

     = Msg. type 14.2 through 14.5 for called DTE address.

33.  Transit Network 1 DNIC

     Reported by X.25/X.75:

     = Msg. type 14.6.nm, where nm is the four BCD digits of DNIC.
     Multiple Msg. type 14.6.nm will be recorded for multiple transit
     network DNIC's.  However, one additional such message will also
     be recorded signaling the ending of the stream where:
       n = FF (a constant value in hex.),
       m = the total number of transit networks just previously being
           reported.

34 - 36  Transit Network 2 - 4 DNIC

     See Item #33.

37.  Local Service Type

     D.N.C.

38.  Tarriff Utility

     Only applicable in DATAPAC for Tymnet.

     = Msg. type 14.18.sssssbbb.  (Reference Acount.doc, Msg. 14.18)

39.  Call id. Billing

     Call id is applicable in X.25/X.75.

     If it is part of the calling/called address, then the 10 BCD digits
     immediately following the DNIC may be the call id.

     In the case for X.75, call id is reported in Msg. 14.9 which is
     normally used for the gateway invoice number.

40.  Date

     D.N.C. (If this means the connect date, then see Item #6.)

41.  Auxiliary Sensor Id.

     N/A. or D.N.C.

42.  Service Region

     D.N.C.

43.  Service Area - End Point Number

     D.N.C.

44.  Intrastate Call Aggregate Holding Time

     N/A or D.N.C.

45.  Interstate Call Aggregate Holding Time

     N/A or D.N.C.

46.  Recording Interval End Time

     If this means the interval of node reporting accounting addendum,
     then it is known to be 15 - 20 minutes and is a function of 
     Tymnet ISIS/Node Code.

47.  Count of Intrastate attempts

     Not directly reflected in raw data.  Must first go through external
     table process to identify the location or site of the orig. and
     dest. interfaces to determine whether the session is an intrastate
     or interstate one, then must sort out the sessions and verify 
     the termination reasons and analyse the patterns of the logins.
     This is strictly an application process utilizing the information
     provided by the raw data.

48.  Count Of Interstate Attempts
     
     See Item #47.

49.  Count Of Intrastate Packet Segment

     This will be another example of application process.

     The packet/segment count is obtainable in Msg. type 14.1 thru 14.8.

50.  Count of Interstate Packet Segment

     Same as Item #49.

51.  Counter Reset
   
     N/A.

52.  Connecting DNIC

     See Item #33.

53.  Trunk Id

     N/A.

54.  Logical Channel Number

     The X.25 LCN is not currently being reported as accounting addendum
     to the Supervisor.

55.  International Data Number
    
     If this means the DNIC, see Item #39.

                     INFO ON HOW TO CORRECT THE SUP TIME

      The command used to correct the Superclock time is:   FTIME  and is of 
   the following format:    
     
             :FTIME n 
     
   where n is the number of seconds (in decimal), by which the Superclock time
   is to be changed.  
     
   To increase time by n (>0) seconds, issue
             :FTIME n                (:FTIME +n  does not work) 
     
   To decrease time by n (>0) seconds issue
             :FTIME -n
     
      The Superclock can be updated only when the GMT is of the form XXXXX000
   (an 8 digit hex. number).  Therefore this command may take anywhere from 
   1 sec to 1 hr 8 minutes.  An 'ESC' will abort the command.   
     
      The FTIME command only updates the Superclock, but in order for the 
   active Supervisor to reset its time, the ETIME command has to be used.

      ALL SUBSEQUENT ASSEMBLIES FOR BBXS CODE FOR VERSION 3.06, 5.02 AND
   6.01 MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IN THEIR TYMFILES FOR TIF AND 
   HIF.

   OPTION(ACCOUNT,12345)      :FIVE DIGIT ACCOUNTING HOST #


      THE SYMBOL "ACCOUNT" WILL NOW BE USED TO SET THE ACCOUNTING HOST NUMBER
   IN PSEUDO-NEEDLE REQUESTS FOR ALL TERMINAL I/F LINES.

      EXISTING TERMINAL INTERFACE SLOTS NEED NOT BE TAKEN DOWN IF THE NUMBERS
   PREVIOUSLY GENERATED BY THE "LOCATION" MACRO HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE SLOT
   WHICH GENERATED THEM.  NIB FILES FOR THOSE EXISTING SLOTS NEED NOT BE 
   RE-ASSEMBLED UNTIL THE SLOT'S CONFIGURATION IS CHANGED.

      HOST INTERFACE LINES WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE NETWORK HOST NUMBER AS THE
   ORIGINATING HOST NUMBER FOR ALL HOST-ORIGINATED CALLS.

      The following "Ring Decoding Guide", is very helpful for all of us who
   are supporting RJE products for 5.02 and above.  Currently there is no
   documentation available on this subject, which can help us decode the 
   Rings.

      I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Eric Buell who helped me
   obtain the following information.

            TWO NEW USER-WRITTEN SUBROUTINES IN FOCUS VERSION 5.0
            -----------------------------------------------------
            -----------------------------------------------------


Written by : Dianne Siler, Remote Computing Svcs Co.
      Date : May 19, 1986


 

   Have you ever wanted to prompt a user for a field in the database but
   there were multiple spellings possible and the user needed to know the  
   correct spelling in order to retrieve the record?
 
   There is finally an answer in Focus 5.0 . . . A new subroutine called:
 
                                   SOUNDEX
   Try it ... You'll like it ...
    
   The calling sequence is:
    
               SOUNDEX(NUMCHAR,INPUT,OUTPUT)
    
   Where:  NUMCHAR    (alpha)   Two character field containing the length
                                of the input field.
    
           INPUT      (alpha)   Input alpha field of length NUMCHAR.
    
           OUTPUT     (alpha)   Four character output.
   
   NOTE:  If NUMCHAR is not between 1 and 99 then '****' is returned
          in OUTPUT.
 
   SOUNDEX can be used for phoenetic ("sounds like") searches, for
   example in surname searches.  The algorithm retains the first
   character of INPUT and assigns a digit to represent each of the
   next 3 'significant' sounds (determined by the algorithm).
 
   Example:
 
        cms type soundex focexec
 
        -PROMPT &SOUND.A10.ENTER APPROXIMATE COUNTRY NAME.
        -SET &SOUND=EDIT(&SOUND ^^ '          ','9999999999');
        DEFINE FILE CAR
        TESTSOUND/A4 WITH COUNTRY=SOUNDEX('10','&SOUND^',TESTSOUND);
        COUSOUND/A4=SOUNDEX('10',COUNTRY,COUSOUND);
        TEST/I1=IF COUSOUND EQ TESTSOUND THEN 1 ELSE 0;
        END
        TABLE FILE CAR
        PRINT COUNTRY COUSOUND TESTSOUND TEST
        END
 
        ex soundex
        ENTER APPROXIMATE COUNTRY NAME
 
        italli
        >
 


        COUNTRY     COUSOUND  TESTSOUND  TEST
        -------     --------  ---------  ----
 
        ENGLAND     E524      I340          0
        JAPAN       J150      I340          0
        ITALY       I340      I340          1   <=== NOTE THE 'MATCH'
        W GERMANY   W265      I340          0
        FRANCE      F652      I340          0
 
 
   There is a second new user subroutine available in release 5.0 of Focus.
   The subroutine called UPCASE will translate all lower case characters
   in a Dialogue Manager variable or in a field into their upper case
   equivalent.
 
   The calling sequence is:
 
               UPCASE(NUMCHAR,INPUT,OUTPUT)
    
   Where:   NUMCHAR    (numeric)   The number of characters in the field
                                   INPUT.
 
            INPUT      (alpha)     The input character string of length
 
            OUTPUT     (alpha)     The resultant character string of length
                                   NUMCHAR with lower case letters
                                   translated to upper case
 
   Note:  If NUMCHAR is less than or equal to zero, blanks are returned
   in OUTPUT.
 
   This routine can be expecially useful when using CRTFORM LOWER for
   data entry where not all fields are to be retained in lower case
   such as the key fields.
 
   Example:
 
        cms type upcase focexec
 
        -SET &TEXT = '123456789012345678901234567';
        -CRTFORM LOWER
        -"ENTER TEXT BELOW:
        -"<&TEXT>"
        -TYPE YOU HAVE INPUT THE FOLLOWING TEXT:  &TEXT
        -SET &UPTEXT=UPCASE(27,&TEXT,'A27');
        -TYPE  IN UPPER CASE, IT IS:   &UPTEXT
 
        >
        ex upcase
        YOU HAVE INPUT THE FOLLOWING:  qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm 1234567890
        IN UPPER CASE, IT IS:          QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM 1234567890
        >
 
   If you have any trouble with either of these new user-written subroutines

      Detailed configuration information is often required to integrate the 
   hardware and software during the staging process. There are often several 
   alternative configuration choices for any one issue. NSSU will not presume
   to know the customer's expectations. Therefore, when a configuration 
   question arises in the staging process which is judged to be significant, 
   the staging process may be suspended or rescheduled pending clarification 
   of the configuration discrepancy.
     
     
                   CONFIGURATION  CONCERNS
     
      The following information must be obviously apparent to the staging 
   staff by default or by information previously provided by the technical 
   staff of the order originator:
     
     
           1. Connector panel connectivity   
     
           2. Cluster interconnectivity - Board and card addressing   
                                          and interconnectivity   
     
           3. LAN configuration    
     
           4. Target code TYMFILE, CMD, and BND file locations   
     
           5. Target code TYMFILE reconciliation to the hardware 
              configuration 
     
           6. Any place a decision is needed which will affect the    
              installation process at the customer site   
     
     
      The above information is required at the time the equipment is released
   from manufacturing to NSSU. NSSU will not preview orders for technical 
   integrity. When information is needed, staging will continue as possible 
   until the answers are provided. Some delay is probable.  
     
     
                   PROCEDURE - DISCREPANCY CORRECTION AND TRACKING 
     
           The process will be as follows for each incident:
     
           1. The NSSU stager will add a mail message to the order in 
              question addressed to the following people if they are
              identified in the OES order:  TYMNET Technical Contact,    
              Salesperson, TYMNET Order Coordinator  
     
           2. The OES mail message will identify the discrepancy or question    
              in detail
     
           3. The OES mail message will estimate (from NSSU's perspective) the  
              probable delay in days or weeks, which will usually be
              cumulative to the response time of the query.    
     
           4. The OES order coordinator will reschedule the staging commit 
              date and subsequent ship date.    
        
           5. Phone conversation between principles is encouraged, however,
              corrective action will only commence upon receipt of the   
              authorizing mail message from the OES order coordinator.   
     
     
                   SMART ORDERING - DISCREPANCY PREVENTION    
     
      A means to insure that NSSU has all the needed information to prevent 
   delays in staging is to complete and deliver one of the following forms 
   to NSSU prior to the equipment arriving in staging.  The forms are located
   in NSSU directory on systems 28 and 56. Each form identifies the location 
   of the sunpporting document and related forms.
     
           The file names are:
     
           SECONF.FRM      for stand-alone ENGINES with PSM buckets   
     
           PSCONF.FRM      for Port Switched clusters  
     
           MPCONF.FRM      for MPX cluster systems

      THIS ONTYME IS AN INFORMATIONAL GUIDELINE AS TO HOW BACKUP REQUESTS AND 
   PUBLIC NETWORK CODE ISSUES ARE HANDLED IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION.  THERE 
   HAVE BEEN SOME SLIGHT REVISIONS TO THE BACKUP REQUEST PROCEDURES.  PLEASE
   NOTE THE FOLLOWING TOPICS OF INTEREST THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED:


   I.   BACKUP REQUESTS

   II.  BACKUP REQUEST PROCEDURES - INTERNAL

   III. CODE ISSUES - SHORT TERM

   IV.  CODE ISSUES - LONG TERM


      IT IS IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION'S BEST INTEREST TO ENSURE CUSTOMER 
   SATISFACTION AS WELL AS INTERNAL COMPLIANCE.  WE ARE INTERESTED IN ANY 
   PROBLEMS YOU MAY BE EXPERIENCING SO THAT WE CAN TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO
   ALLEVIATE THEM IN THE FUTURE.  PLEASE FORWARD ANY COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS 
   TO ME DIRECTLY.  I CAN BE REACHED AT (408)942-5180, TYMOPS.B/AGUA, IN 
   NETWORK OPERATIONS, SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA.

   THANK YOU




I.  BACKUP REQUESTS
    ______ ________

    A.  BACKUP REQUESTS ARE FOR SLOT CODE ONLY UNLESS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
        SITUATIONS OCCUR:

        1.  THE REQUEST IS FOR A LAB MACHINE.

        2.  PRIOR APPROVAL HAS BEEN GIVEN BY THE MANAGER OF PROJECT 
            IMPLEMENTATION TO BACKUP PUBLIC NETWORK NODE CODE.


    B.  THERE IS AN EXEC PROGRAM AVAILABLE VIA ONTYME TO SUBMIT A BACKUP
        REQUEST.  TO ACCESS THE PROGRAM, TYPE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND:

        EXEC *** FORMS.BACKUP

        THIS FILE HAS BEEN VALIDATED ON ALL INTERNAL HOSTS.  PLEASE COMPLETE
        FULLY AND ACCURATELY.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE CKSUMS ARE INCLUDED
        AS REQUESTED PER THE FORMAT.  ALL BACKUP REQUESTS ARE THEN SENT TO 
        THE ONTYME ID, TYMOPS.BACKUP.

    C.  SLOT CODE WILL ONLY BE BACKED UP FROM THE FOLLOWING REGIONAL 
        DIRECTORIES:

        WATECH   -   WESTERN REGIONAL DIRECTORY
        CENTCODE -   CENTRAL REGIONAL DIRECTORY
        METTECH  -   EASTERN REGIONAL DIRECTORY
        INTLTECH -   EXTERNAL NETWORK SERVICES
        PNTS     -   PRIVATE NETWORK GATEWAYS
        PACTECH  -   PACIFIC RIM DIRECTORY
        TMCSCODE -   NETWORK QUALITY CONTROL

    D.  CODE FOR NODES BELOW 5000 IS AVAILABLE ON SYSTEM 25 (PRIMARY) AND
        70 (SECONDARY).  CODE FOR NODE 5000 AND ABOVE IS LOCATED ON
        SYSTEM 54 (PRIMARY) AND 33 (SECONDARY).  SLOT CODE WILL ONLY 
        BE BACKED UP FROM THE DESIGNATED PRIMARY SYSTEM (25 OR 54).  BACK-
        UPS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED FROM THE SECONDARY SYSTEM (70 OR 33)
        IF THE PRIMARY SYSTEMS ARE DOWN.

    E.  ALL BACKUP REQUESTS WILL BE COMPLETED BY 12 NOON THE SAME DAY THE
        ONTYME IS RECEIVED.  THE SAME AFTERNOON, A BACKUP SUMMARY REPORT
        IS RELEASED STATING THE STATUS OF ALL BACKUP REQUESTS RECEIVED 
        THAT MORNING.  IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THE FIELD MONITOR
        THIS REPORT TO ENSURE BACKUP REQUEST COMPLETION.  THERE MAY
        BE SOME DELAYS DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL, i.e., 
        host out of ports, system down, THUS INHIBITING OUR TIME FACTORS.

    F.  A BATCH REQUEST IS SENT THE SAME EVENING TO TAPE ALL FILES WORKED
        ON THAT SAME DAY TO THE SECONDARY SYSTEMS VIA FEDERAL EXPRESS.


II.  BACKUP REQUEST PROCEDURES - INTERNAL
     ------ ------- ----------

     A.  ONTYMES FOR THE USERNAME TYMOPS.BACKUP ARE PULLED ROUTINELY, FIRST
         THING EVERY MORNING.  THE BACKUP REQUESTS RECEIVED ARE THEN DISTRI-
         BUTED AMONGST THE INSTALLATION COORDINATORS IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION.
         PLEASE NOTE THAT BACKUPS ARE ONLY PULLED ONCE EACH DAY.

     B.  THE CKSUMS ON THE BACKUP REQUEST ARE COMPARED TO THE CURRENT CKSUMS
         IN THE DESIGNATED REGIONAL DIRECTORY.  REQUESTS MAY BE REJECTED AT
         THIS POINT FOR ONE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS:

         1.  THE CKSUMS ON THE BACKUP REQUEST DO NOT MATCH THE CURRENT 
             CKSUMS IN THE DESIGNATED REGIONAL DIRECTORY.

         2.  NO FILES WERE FOUND IN THE DESIGNATED DIRECTORY/SYSTEM.

         3.  THE SLOT REQUESTED TO BE BACKED UP EXCEEDS THE SLOT CORE ALLOCA-
             TION ON THE TYMFILE AND THERE IS NO ROOM FOR EXPANSION.

     C.  A DIRECTORY OF THE NODE TO BE BACKED UP IS DONE FOR (2) CHECKS:

         1.  THERE MAY BE A TEMPORARY FILE AVAILABLE.  THIS WOULD SIGNAL
             A PENDING PROJECT REQUIRING SPECIAL TREATMENT.
 
         2.  WHICH FILES NEED TO BE DELETED  TO ACCOMODATE THE NEW INCOMING
             FILES.

     D.  THE SLOT CODE IS THEN RENAMED FROM THE DESIGNATED REGIONAL DIRECTORY
         TO THE TYMNET OR TYM5 DIRECTORY.

     E.  A NEW BND FILE IS CREATED USING THE MERLIN PROGRAM.  THIS NEW BND
         FILE INCLUDES ALL OF THE MOST CURRENT SLOT CODE IN THE TYMNET OR
         TYM5 DIRECTORY.

     F.  THE NEW FILE IS THEN DECLARED "ALL READ READ".  THE CODE CAN NOW
         BE ACCESSED BY ALL USERS.


III.CODE ISSUES - SHORT TERM
    ---- ------   ----- ----

    A.  A CODE GENERATOR IS AVAILABLE ON A (24) HOUR BASIS SIMPLY BY
        CONTACTING NETWORK CONTROL.  NETWORK CONTROL WILL THEN 'BEEP' THE 
        CODE GENERATOR ON-CALL.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CODE GENERATOR IS ONLY
        RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC NETWORK NODE CODE.

    B.  SHORT TERM CODE ISSUES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED VIA ONTYME TO THE MANAGER
        OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION.  AS A RESULT, THE CODE WILL BE CORRECTED
        WITHIN (24) HOURS AND LOADED THE FOLLOWING EVENING.  EITHER A VERBAL
        PHONE CALL OR WRITTEN RESPONSE WILL BE SENT BACK TO THE CONCERNED
        INDIVIDUAL WITHIN (48) HOURS, CONFIRMING THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED
        THEIR REQUEST.

    C.  IN URGENT SITUATIONS (CUSTOMER OUT OF NET), A PHONE CALL WILL SUFFICE,
        FOLLOWED BY AN ONTYME.  THE CODE IS CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY AND LOADED
        WHEN POSSIBLE, DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT ANY OTHER CUSTOMERS WILL BE 
        AFFECTED.

    D.  IN CASES WHERE THE TYMFILE IS INDEED CORRECT, THE CODE IS REGENNED
        TO COVER A POSSIBLE GLITCH IN THE ASSEMBLY.


IV. CODE ISSUES - LONG TERM
    ---- ------   ---- ----

    A.  A FORMAL REQUEST CAN BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE MANAGER OF PROJECT
        IMPLEMENTATION REGARDING LONG TERM CODE ISSUES.

    B.  A RESPONSE WILL BE GENERATED BACK TO THE ORIGINATOR ACKNOWLEDGING
        RECEIPT OF REQUEST AND LONG TERM GOALS.  TIME FACTORS ARE ALSO
        DISCUSSED.

    C.  AN ONGOING EXCHANGE WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THE LONG TERM CODE
        ISSUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AND/OR RESOLVED.

                --------------------------------------------

Written by : John Gomes, Mgr. HQQA
      Date : May 22, 1986




    ON MAY 30TH 1986, THE QUALITY ASSURANCE ORGANIZATION WILL TAKE OVER
    SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION FROM NTD.  THE NEW PROCEDURE FOR THIS PROCESS
    IS ATTACHED FOR YOUR REFERENCE.


    TYPES OF DIRECTORIES

    Software  products  will  be  submitted from the  NTD  Beta  Test 
    directory  into the  QA Beta Test  Directory.  See  the following
    figure:


            |--------------|    |     |-------------|
            |     NTD      |    |     |    *QA      |
            |  Beta Test   |--->--->--|  Beta Test  |
            |  Directory   |    |     |  Directory  |
            |--------------|    |     |-------------|
                                |            |
                                |            |
                                |     |-------------|
                                |     |     QA      | Limited Release
                                |     |   Source    |
                                |     |  Directory  | Full Release
                                      |-------------|
    
         * = Note - All products contained in the NTD beta test
         directory will not neccessarily be contained in the
         QA beta test directory.  QA has the right to selectively
         place products in this directory.
    
    
    NAMING CONVENTION FOR VERSION NUMBERS FOR ALL DIRECTORIES
    
    The  procedure for version numbers will be as  follows:
    
         - Beta Test Products will begin with x.x1.
           (For example - 2.01)
    
         - Beta Test Products will increment by one when a new
           release is submitted.
           (For example - 2.01 to 2.99) (A PIR has been submitted to
           change the numbering scheme in ISIS from octal to decimal)
    
         - Once the beta test product is approved for limited release
           it will retain the same version number. 
           
    
    
    PATCHES
 
    Patches  will  only  be made to products which are in  a  release 
    state.  Only  patches which have a Network Software Report  (NSR) 
    and which are tested will be entered in the QA Source  Directory.   
    (Note - For beta test products a new version will be submitted to 
    QA.   Exception - If the customer is down or unable to adequately 
    use the product a patch will be accepted with an approved NSR.)
    
    NUMBER OF RELEASES
    
    There  will only be 1 beta test version of a product at  any  one 
    time. (Note - Customers must upgrade to latest beta test version. 
    Exception  - Customer may use existing version,  but must upgrade 
    if  a  re-gen or bug fix is needed.)   Once approved for  limited 
    release  (Length  of beta test will be approximately  90  days.),  
    the product will be transferred to the source directory, where it 
    will reside until replaced.  When the next version enters limited 
    release,  the  old  full released version will be deleted  in  18 
    months and will no longer be supported.
    
    RELEASE NOTICES
    
    All  product  release notices will be submitted by  NTD  Baseline 
    Distribution  to Quality Assurance.   All release notices against 
    products  in  limited  and full release will  be  distributed  by 
    Quality Assurance to *** alltech.  Beta Test release notices will 
    be  distributed  by Quality Assurance to the  Regional  Technical 
    Managers.   It will be responsibility of the RTMs to notify their 
    staff  of new beta test releases for customer  upgrade  purposes.  
    The format for the release notices will be similar to NTDs.   The 
    exception  will  be the change of the NTD contact to a  Technical 
    Services or Quality Assurance representative.  

    MONITORING OF PRODUCTS 
    
    The QA Manager will monitor the beta test  reports to assure that 
    products move in a reasonable amount of time from beta to source.  
    QA  will  obtain  the  anticipated release  dates  from  NTD  for 
    scheduling  purposes.  QA will review pertinent test results  and 
    will  consult  with  Technical Services,  Marketing and  NTD  for 
    approval  for  limited  release.  Products which are  in  limited 
    release  will  be  considered  for  full  release  by  the  above 
    departments  in  approximately 90 days.   QA will  be  the  final 
    release authority for all products.

      Network Console version 3.01, in public network, displays "login error:
   25 (or 26 or 27)" instead of a host not available message when an accssed
   XOM host does not exist in the network.  This is caused by a mis-matched 
   I/O parameter in Network Console 3.01 and Pascal Nucleus 11.12.  Before
   the new version is released, please bear in mind the "login error: #" 
   message stands for "Host not available thru net".

      The memory needed for 5.06 nodecode for a Tymnet-II, ISIS machine, in
   decimal kilobytes, is as follows:

   108 +
   if ZITEL specified then 1 +
   2 * SILINS +                       (2K per SIO line)
   .11 * NSLOT +
   .4 * (NLUS0-SILINS) +              (.4K per sync line)
   x * NDP +                          (x = .26 (REBILD) or .1 (not REBILD))
   y * NPTHR +                        (y = .35 (REBILD) or .26 (not REBILD))
   .21 * NXUBLK +                     (# XRAY users - default = 3)
   3.75 * XLINKS +
   sum(memory requirements for all TIILNKS)
   KB.

   The memory requirement for a TIILNK = 1.55 + (.271 * windowsize).

      I figured this formula out by playing around with the TYMFILE, trying
   100's of different configurations, and also by checking the listing of 
   nodecode to make sure the parameters were relatively independent.  Still, 
   this formula seems to predict a little high - as much as 10% over.  So be 
   advised.
