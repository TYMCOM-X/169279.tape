TMCS Message Meanings

The reasons for "data on an unassigned channel" may be  that there was a
zap sent on that channel, causing node code to think the circuit was
terminated (or now unassigned) and following the zap being sent out data
was received.  This would be because of timing (data in the circuit not
yet cleaned up by the zap).

Neighbor 0 may have been reported because this circuit was a dispatcher
circuit where there would be no node number, the permuter tables could
have been corrupted, or this may be an undetected node code bug
(probably the cause was this was a dispatcher circuit).

Circuit lifetimes are reported after certain error conditions occur.
This is to aid in tracking the causes of problems.  If the circuit
lifetime is long, you know the circuit has been up for awhile.  If the
circuit lifetime is very short you may have an indication of a timing or
race condition occurring which may be a potential cause of the
associated error message.

In this instance, the circuit lifetime message may be being sent in
error so the times reported may be of questionable value.  There is no
negative impact so this is nothing to worry about.

Original question:

2112 node report, data on unassigned channel 1E
       neighbor 0  <8.2>
2112 node report, circuit lifetime 310 seconds on channel 1e

Why is there "data on unassigned channel"?
Why is there a "non-existent" neighbor node "0" to node 2112?
What is the purpose of reporting circuit lifetimes?

SUBJECT:

ISIS Dispatcher messages

Anyone writing an application slot should be well versed with the ISIS
Dispatcher messages.  The application slot does not talk directly to the
Supervisor.  The Node Code talks to the Sup and translates messages from
the Sup to ISIS messages.

During logging mode, Sup messages can cause Node Code to send the
following ISIS messages:  

     1) 01-9D data text string 
     2) AF hang up 3) B4 normal logon status 
     4) B5 logon failure 
     5) B6 successful logon 
     6) B8 super-'hang up'

The actual text in the data text string depends on whether extended
logon status was set.  I did not include a list of text strings since
specific messages can be downloaded for particular hosts by such
programs as TMCS.  Thus, there is no such entity as a complete list of
text strings.  An intelligent interface can do quite well be setting
extended logon status obey the hang signals and use the error code in
the B4 and B5 messages.

Once the circuit is connected then there is no way for the supervisor to
send any message on that circuit (unless, of course, the circuit was
built to probe).

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

A customer needs to write an application to access a host and needs to
know all possible messages that could be sent to the user's application
from the supervisor.  This includes logon to the network and anything
that might be sent during the session.

SUBJECT:

Circuit Nodecode REBUILD Failures 

Rebuild does not rebuild circuits in every case.  There is a way to
increase the percentage of successful rebuilds that does not require new
development.  If you turn on rebuild in the Supervisor base then when
the origination node loses its command circuit, the circuit can still be
rebuilt.  When the origination loses its command circuit it cannot send
up the rebuild request so the rebuild fails and the origination cannot
report this to the Supervisor since it does not have a command circuit.
By turning on rebuild in the Sup base when the origination node loses
its command circuit then the origination's rebuild requests are buffered
until its command circuit is rebuilt.  Thus, user circuits are rebuilt
even when the command circuits are lost due to a link outage.

Turning on rebuild in the Supervisor base also increases the chances of
rebuild succeeding when the destination node loses its command circuit
due to link outage.  Since the destination's command circuit is to be
rebuilt then supervisor still thinks the destination node is in the net.
Thus, a rebuild needle will be created unless the destination is dead
ended since a path must exist to the destination.  The rebuild needle
could fail if it's path happened to include a downed link which is
unlikely since the rebuild request includes the neighbors of the downed
link.  Thus, the likelihood of rebuild succeeding when the destination
node loses its command circuit is increased.

There is a drawback to turning on rebuild in the sup base.  If the sup
base crashes or is isolated from the rest of the net by link outages
then the nodes still think they have command circuits for one to two
minutes until the nodes time out the rebuildable command channel.  In
that period of time, the nodes will reject takeovers from sups of a
lower number (higher priority) than the current (isolated) sup.  Thus,
for a period of a couple minutes there will, in essence, be no active
sup in the net.  If the troubles caused by losing command circuits
outweighs the potential problems of a sup base crash/isolation then
enabling rebuild in the sup base is an effective means of increasing the
percentage of successful rebuilds.

Another drawback is that rebuild requires more memory in the Supervisor
base.

Note:  All of the above assumes that Node Code version 5.22 with
REBTST EQ 1 (or version 5.31 which defaults REBTST to 1) is being
used in the affected network.  V5.22 and REBTST fixes numerous rebuild
bugs and has major improvements to the rebuild logic.  If the sup
base is gong to run rebuild, it is strongly recommended that V5.22+
be used.
  
ORIGINAL QUESTION:

Circuit REBUILD Failures
 
The customer has complained of a high number of circuit rebuild failures.
Information obtained from PROBE shows that the vast majority of failures
are due to: UNKNOWN DESTINATION NODE
 
The following is my interpretation of what's probably causing this reason
to be given for failure. Of course I could be "off base", in which case I
would appreciate your interpretation of the message:
 
The destination node is actually dropping out of the net, in which case
the reason is completely valid for the loss of the command circuit from
the SUPervisor to this node, when that portion of the circuit path or
link that's lost is shared by the SUP's command circuit and the user's
session circuit resulting in the user's originating node generating a
single rebuild request.
 
When the command circuit from the SUP to the node is lost the SUP no
longer recognizes this node as being in the net and attempts to retake
the node via an alternate path.  The SUP receives the rebuild request
before it has time to take the node and therefore rejects the request
due to the above reason.
 
If my analysis of the situation is correct, then one or all of the
following fixes could be implemented to reduce the number of rebuild
failures encountered:

1. Allow the requesting node to send more than a single request for rebuild
   before giving up.

2. Provide for the requesting node to wait a sufficient amount of time
   to allow the SUP time to retake the lost node before sending a rebuild
   request.
 
3. Give the SUP the capability to retain enough information concerning
   a lost node until it has retaken the node or determined that retake is
   not possible at which time it can attempt or reject the rebuild request
   accordingly.

Notice of Change in Gateway Service from Canada DNIC 3020
NOTICE OF CHANGE IN INTERNATIONAL SERVICE 

The change described below affects ALL terminal-originated calls from
Datapac Canada (DNIC 3020).  Be sure to let all your customers know that
they can be informed and prepared!

On Datapac, the default value for X.3 parameter 4 (PAD idletimer) is
zero.  Currently, TYMNET's X.75 gateways to Datapac set parameter 4 to a
value of 80 (4 seconds) after call-establishment on ALL inbound calls
where the protocol-id indicates the call was terminal originated.  This
is a hang-over from days past, no other TYMNET X.75 gateways set X.3
parameter 4 in this way.

After August 14, 1988 TYMNET will no longer over-ride the Datapac
idletimer.  In common with all other TYMNET X.75 gateways, users or
their application program(s), will be responsible for setting an
appropriate value for the idletimer if necessary.

This change is necessary for some important reasons:

1 - To give applications the chance to select an appropriate idletimer
so the response time will be "as expected".  Currently, many
applications have better response via Telenet than Tymnet for this
reason.

2 - To enable TYMNET to offer X.PC access from Datapac.  Our recommended
PAD parameters for X.PC requires a 1/2 second idletimer - a 4 second
timer causes large delays and results in session failures.

FURTHER DETAILS:

A few applications may be reliant on TYMNET to set Datapac's idletimer
for them.  Once this change is in effect, either the application or the
user will need to set the idletimer to an appropriate value.  An example
of an affected application is described below.  Brief instructions on
how to set the idletimer to a new value are also given.

Customers with programmed logon sequences may need to to change their
logon scripts.  The time from now until August 14th should be sufficient
for customers to adapt, if necessary.  Contact External Network Services
IMMEDIATELY if your customer foresees a problem making the deadline.

The pending change improves the quality of service for the great majority of applications and will enable us to offer
new services such as X.PC access via Datapac.

                            >>>EXAMPLE <<<

AN AFFECTED APPLICATION:  A terminal user running a full-screen
emulation places a call from Datapac to Tymnet.

The user hits a "PF" key to send each screen.  Since, in this example
application, the "PF" key does not end with a data-forwarding character
(default <cr>), a non-zero idletimer is critical if the user's data is
to ever get sent to the host.

Currently, the idletimer is set by Tymnet just after the call is
established to a value of 4 seconds.  So, even if the destination DTE
does not (or cannot) set the idletimer, the data will forward from the
PAD buffer after 4 seconds of idleline.

After August 14th, 1988 the users and applications must choose and set a
non-zero value idletimer as appropriate for themselves.  This could be
done in one of at least three ways:-

1. The user/script sends a "SET 4:xx" command at the PAD prompt upon
   first connecting to the PAD.  xx is the value of the timer in 1/20ths of
   a second.  EG:  80 = 4 seconds.

2. Use the "PROF N" command to select a complete new PAD profile (N, an
   integer) with appropriate alternate settings.

2) The destination DTE application, being connected via X.25, sends an
X.29 Set-PAD packet to configure the terminal PAD appropriately.  In
some respects, this the preferred method.
