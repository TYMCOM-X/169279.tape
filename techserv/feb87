                    1.1.1  Dumping all of memory instead of slot

        This will describe two methods to deal with software dumps.  The choice
        depends upon your needs and perhaps the nature of your patience.

        Extracting Slot Dump From A Full Engine Dump           January 28, 1987


                    1.2.1  Obtaining a Merlin map

        For either  of these two  methods it  is necessary to  obtain a  map of
        where,  in physical  memory, your  slot and  its segments  are located.
        This is most conveniently done using MERLIN.  First, some terms  that I
        will try to use consistently:


        Physical  memory.  The  engine has  contiguous memory  from hexadecimal
        address 00000 to 0FFFFF. (This  presumes a one meg machine.   I suppose
        there  might  be  some  smaller  machines  still  in  existence)  These
        addresses are physical memory addresses and are the addresses that ISIS
        will use internal and are the addresses that data in a full engine dump
        will be relative to.


        Virtual  memory.  The  engine has  a device  known as  a MAC.   The MAC
        allows a  program to think  it is addressing,  say location  10000, and
        actually address location 3F00.   A detailed discussion of how  it does
        this  is  beyond the  scope  of  this document.   Please  refer  to the
        discussion on the MAC in the engine document.  Slots in ISIS are always
        executed under the control of the MAC, hence the code is  assembled for
        a  slot  into  virtual  addresses  very  different  than  the  physical
        addresses that the slot  actually resides in. In normal  operation this
        is not a problem since DDT conveniently lies to you.   When you  ask it
        to read memory  location 10000 it will  actually give you the  value at
        the appropriate physical address and tell you it was at 10000.  (Unless
        you run DDT in slot FF in which case all addresses are physical.)


        Engine dump.  This is the dump obtained from LOADII by means of the "D"
        command.  The  addresses given to  LOADII are physical  addresses.  The
        machine to be dumped must be running the bootstrap.  The result  of the
        dump is much like  a .BND file.  It is  a binary image file that  has a
        copy of the engine memory as seen with physical addresses.


        Slot dump.  This is the dump  obtained from LOADII by means of  the "U"
        command.   The addresses  dumped are  usually obtained  by  LOADII from
        reading the CTA table.  The addresses are always virtual  addresses and
        will match the addresses in the "NIB" file assembled with the slot.


        The problem with an engine dump is that the addresses are  physical and
        do not match  the symbols in  the slot nib  file.  They will  match the
        symbols in the ISIS nib file should you be looking for an ISIS problem.


        What is  needed then  is a means  of translating  the address  from the
        symbol in the slot's nib file into the physical address that is  in the
        dump file.  The procedure for this follows:



                                           2

        Obtain a map of physical  memory to virtual memory using MERLIN.  To do
        this you will need to have  the ISIS nib file and the slot's  nib file.
        Current policy seems to not  preserve the ISIS nib file.  In  that case
        you can use the BND file just as well.  Since that is current  policy I
        will use that for the example.

        14   4DA00  4DB1F


        This example is from the real problem mentioned in the beginning.  Note
        that I did not bother to  bind in the node code. I was  only interested
        in slot one (a  CONSAT) and hence left  slot 0 out.  The  technique can
        work for any slot.  Take care  to destroy the bnd file that  you create
        with this and do not destroy the master copy in the TYMNET directory.


        The section of  the map under the  heading SLOT MAP gives  the physical
        addresses that are allocated for  each slot.  A given slot may  not use
        all of this area.


        The section of the map under the heading MAP OF SLOT  1 gives a  map of
        where each segment is located  in physical memory.  This is the  key to
        translating virtual addresses into physical addresses.

                    1.2.2  Reading the nib file

        Once you have a map of  segments into physical memory you are  ready to
        look at the  dump file.  I will  describe one technique. With  a little
        imagination I'm sure  you can think of  other techniques that  might be
        more useful for your situation.


        The dump file created  by LOADII is the same  as a nib file  created by
        NAD.  The intent is that it  be read into nad directly.  Once  you have
        read the  dump file  into nad  you can  display physical  addresses and
        their contents by  techniques that should  already be familiar  to you.
        The problem then is to know what physical addresses to examine  to find
        a desired virtual  address.  It is entirely  possible to open  the slot
        nib file from nad and read  in the symbols from there.  (take  care not
        to read in  the object from  the nib file)   This is no  different than
        what you  would do  if you  had a slot  dump and  wished to  append the
        symbol table.  Of course the symbols will not match the object.   To do
        that you will need to do some translation.  For example:


        Suppose that there was a location with the label "ORING" in the example
        used above.   You could find  the virtual address  of this  location as
        follows:


        ORING=21000


        (note: you enter ORING= and nad tells you 21000.)  Now comes the tricky
        part.  Remember that a virtual address is composed of a  segment number
        followed by 8  bits of page number  followed by 8 bits  of displacement
        from the beginning of the page.  For this purpose the low order 16 bits
        of the  virtual address can  be thought of  as a displacement  from the
        beginning of the segment defined by the high order 4 bits.
         
           _________________Segment number
           |  
           |  ______________Displacement from the beginning of the 
           |  |             segment.
           | /\
           |/  \
           21000


        To  convert to  a  physical address,  use  the segment  portion  of the
        virtual address to  select a segment from  the map supplied  by merlin.
        In this case the segment number  is two.  Next to the segment 2  in the
        map of slot one  is the physical start  address of segment 2.   In this
        case the  address is 53A00.   Add the displacement  to 53A00.   In this
        case 53A00+1000.  You can get nad to do this arithmetic for you by:



                                           4
        Extracting Slot Dump From A Full Engine Dump           January 28, 1987


        53A00+1000[


        The "[" command will cause nad to display the location  addressed after
        the arithmetic is done thereby saving a step.  You could  terminate the
        entry with "="  and simply get the  translated address.  Hence  in this
        case, virtual address 21000 known by the symbol "ORING" is the  same as
        physical address 54A00.  For your convenience it is possible  to define
        your  own local  symbols  that provide  the beginning  address  of each
        segment and hence shorten the time required for entry.  For example:


        53A00:S2


        Would define a symbol "S2" with a value of 53A00.  You could then use


        S2+1000[


        to translate  and read  virtual address 21000.   Be careful.   An error
        will have very confusing results and may not be immediately obvious.






                          1.3  Extracting a slot from a dump






                    1.3.1  Some notes from the Tools and Utilities document

        For those of you willing to make use of an obscure feature of nad it is
        possible to extract a  slot from an engine  dump and create a  nib fill
        with all of the addresses  relocated from physical to virtual.   If you
        are desperate  enough, it  is even  possible to  use this  technique to
        extract a slot nib file from a bnd file.


        To describe this  technique I will  paraphrase some information  in the
        Tools and Utilities document.  This  is in reference to the  section on
        NAD Image  Binary File Usage.  (section 4 in  my somewhat  ancient copy
        dated Oct 19, 1982)


        The ";G" command has three optional parameters. They are:


                                           5

         |__________________The physical address as it appears in the
                            open nib file.





                    1.3.2  Procedure for extracting a slot nib file

        To extract a slot nib file and translate it into virtual addresses from
        a physical address file such as an engine dump file do the following:


        Obtain a slot map from merlin.


        Run nad and open the dump file.


        Using the information in the map from merlin, create ";G"  commands for
        each segment of the slot you want to extract.
        Example:
         
        R NAD
        %F  ND2703.DMP
          ________________________Physical address for start of segment 0
          |     __________________Virtual address for start of segment 0
          |     |     ____________Physical end of segment 0
          |     |     |     ______Physical start of segment 0
          |     |     |     |                               
          |     |     |     |
         / \   / \   / \   / \
        /   \ /   \ /   \ /   \
        4DC00,00000,4F4D3-4DC00+1;G
                    \___________/   
                         |________Byte count to read segment 0


        The above is repeated for each  of the segments in the merlin  map.  At

        The  TTE  curriculum is  highly  structured with  each  course assuming
        completion of prerequisites.   Only students who have  the prerequisite
        knowledge are able  to get the full  benefit of the course.   We cannot
        permit students without prerequisites to enroll in courses because this
        is not fair to them or to the other students.  However, we do recognize
        that employees  may have  gained the required  knowledge in  ways other
        than  completing  the  pererquisite TTE  class  (i.e.  outside courses,
        experience).


        In our continuing drive to make TTE Training relevant to each students'
        job requirements, we are  revising and reemphasizing the  procedure for
        students to demonstrate mastery  of course material without  taking the
        TTE course.


        We are developing  challange tests for  each of the  major prerequisite
        courses.  If the student passes the exam, his/her transcript is updated
        to show that the course was passed by exam.  The procedure to challenge
        a course is as follows:

                Step 1                                  Responsibility
               ________                                 ________________
         
        1.  Determine course content and                Student and Student's
            objectives by seeing the course             Manager
            dption in the catalog or
            EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
        2.  Request a test fron the TTE Registrar       Student's Manager
            via Ontyme EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
            or phone 408/942-5042
        3.  Send test and instructions to the           TTE Registrar

        4.  Administer test to the student              Student's Manager
        5.  Return test to TTE Registrar at             Student's Manager
            2665 North First Street,
            San Jose, CA  95134
            Test must be returned to TTE within 2
            weeks or the test will not be accepted
        6.  Grade the test                              TTE Instructor
        7.  Notify student's manager of results and     TTE Registrar
            update transcript


        For example suppose an employee  wants to take TTE 400  Introduction to
        ISIS but has  not taken the prerequisite  course TTE 100, 101,  and 102
        yet feels that he knows  the material.  The manager should  contact the
        TTE  registrar for  the  TTE 100  challenge test,  administer  the test
        following the instructions, and return the test to TTE.  If the student
        passed, the manager can request the TTE 101 challenge exam.   After the
        student has passes  all prerequisite course  by exam his  enrollment in
        the TTE 400 will be confirmed.


        This  process will  take time  so  you need  to plan  ahead.   TTE will
        respond to requests  for tests within 24  hours and will send  the test
        via ontyme if there are no graphics or by mail.


        The returned test must be mailed and must indicate both the student and
        manager's  signature.   We will  notify  you of  the  results  within 1
        business day, upon receipt of the completed test.


        Challenge tests are currently available for the following courses:

                        TTE 100
                        TTE 101
                        TTE 102
                        TTE 110
                        TTE 200
                        TTE 210
                        TTE 220
                        TTE 300
                        TTE 400


        There will be a $50.00 fee for each test administered.


        Each student may take only 1 test at a time.  Each challenge  test will
        be administered to the same  student only once.  If the  student fails,
        he must satisfy the requirement by attending class.

        Original Question by : Elaine Espouy, TNSC Technical Service
                 Response by : Adela Lee, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                        Date : December 29, 1986







        ORIGINAL QUESTION:



        Could you advise as to which events the TIF uses the PVCTIMER paramter?


        The documentation states that it is 'the time to wait before the PVC is
        rebuilt'.  However, looking into the code, I noticed the timer (lgintv)
        ID decremented each halfsecond (in HSEC1...) . Therefore, does PVCTIMER
        parameter represent the  time to wait in  seconds or does  it represent
        the double time to wait for rebuilding the PVC.






        RESPONSE:



        You have  caught another  error in  the SYSGEN  manual. In  this macro,
        PVCTIMER(t), it should be specified as half-seconds, not in  seconds as
        described in the manual.


        In the case where R SHUT monitor command, DETACH or ZAP ISIS message is
        received,  the  slot  does  take  the  value  't'  as  the  real timing
        measurement for PVC rebuilding  interval. However, this is not  true in


                                          10
        SDLC PVCTIMER Macro                                    January 28, 1987


        the other cases.   During logon failure  state (for example  a DETACH)n
        ZAP or LOGON  FAILURE ISIS message, being  received at logon  mode, the
        slot takes  the value 't'  and doubles it  as PVC  rebuilding interval.
        Futhermore, once the  logon retry limit  reaches 0, the  PVC rebuilding
        interval will be 10 times  the value 't' as defined in  PVCTIMER macro.

        The Public  and Private  Network marketing  departments are  pleased to
        announce new PIR submission procedures.  We hope this will make it even
        easier  for  you  to  get  your  new  feature/product  ideas submitted,
        examined, and acted upon.


        There are two ways to submit a PIR:

            1.   Using OnTyme's EXEC Capability
         
                 Type :EXEC *** FORMS.SUBMITPIR.  The program will prompt
                 you for all the information needed to submit a PIR.
                 Please do not leave any required sections blank.
                 Incomplete PIRs will be rejected and returned to the
                 requestor.
         
         
         
            2.   Using Your Personal Computer
         
                 If you are lucky enough to have access to a PC, you may
                 want to create the PIR on your PC and upload it to
                 OnTyme.  The PIR form can be captured onto your PC disk
                 by typing :REA *** FORMS.PIR with the PC comm software
                 record option on.  After editing the form, use your PC
                 comm software to upload it into OnTyme.  Send the PIR to
                 NETS.NSPIRS.
         

        Please  call  the  appropriate  Product  Manager  at  HQ  if  you  need
        assistance completing the form.  If the PIR is for a specific customer,

        verify  your  request  with  the  customer.   If  you  have  additional
        information, send it by mail or  fax it.  Our fax number is  (408) 942-
        5082.


        Once  the PIR  is submitted,  it will  be reviewed  by  the appropriate
        product manager.  Marketing  will respond to  all PIRs within  30 days,
        either  to  accept  or   reject  the  PIR  or  to   request  additional
        information.   If  your  PIR  is  accepted  by  marketing,  it  will be
        submitted to the JPPC for disposition.


        The PIR must be submitted by the 15th of each month to be  processed in
        that month.


        You must use one of these convenient methods to submit your PIR.

        UTS 40 Communications Protocol                         January 28, 1987






                          5 -  UTS 40 Communications Protocol







        Written by : John Burrough, HQ Network Staff Consultant
              Date : January 5, 1987






        The UTS 40 (Univac terminal) provides interactive communication  with a
        host processor over a communications line.  Interchange between the UTS
        40 and the  host processor consists of  a sequence of messages  and the
        message  interchange  is  governed  by a  series  of  rules  that allow
        information to be conveyed in either direction in a standard manner.


        The basic element  in the UTS 40  communications protocal is  an error-
        free poll from the host processor.   A poll is a message from  the host
        processor that  requests a response  from the UTS  40.  The UTS  40 can
        send  a message  to the  host processor  only when  polled by  the host
        processor.


        After sending text to a UTS 40 station, the host processor  must always
        send  a poll  to  verify that  the  station received  the  text message
        correctly.   If  the  poll  response  from  the  station   contains  an
        acknowledgment, then  the text was  received correctly by  the station.
        If the poll response does  not contain an acknowledgment, the  the text
        was not received correctly by the station.  The basic  message sequence
        required to send text from the host processor to a UTS 40 station is as
        follows.  The host processor sends text to the UTS 40 station  and then
        polls to determine whether or not the text was received correctly (that
        is, with good character and block parity).  The station responds to the
        poll  with  an   acknowledgment,  indicating  it  re-ceived   the  text
        correctly.  The  host processor  then signifies  proper receipt  of the
        station acknowledgment by including an acknowledgment in the  next poll
        to that station.  The station then responds with a  no-traffic message,
        indicating that it received the acknowledgment and has  nothing further
        to send.




                                          14
        UTS 40 Communications Protocol                         January 28, 1987


        Stations on a communications line are distinguished from one another by
        an addressing  scheme that  identifies the  intended recipient(s)  of a
        host processor message and,  in like manner, identifies  the responding
        station.


        The UTS 40 addressing scheme utilizes a 3-character sequence consisting
        of  a  remote  identifier  (RID),  a  station  identifier  (SID)  and a
        peripheral  device identifier  (DID).  The  possible RID,  SID  and DID
        characters are as follows.  Of  the possible 48 RID's, 47  are specific
        (assigned to  specific stations)  and 1 (the  SP character)  is general
        (recognized by all  stations).  Of the 32  SIDs, 31 are specific  and 1
        (the P character) is  general.  Of the 95  DIDs, 94 are specific  and 1
        (the p character) is general.


        Each  station on  a  communications line  is uniquely  identified  by a
        specific  RID and  specific SID  combination.  Thus,  the address  of a
        station  is sym-bolized  by  RID SID.   Each peripheral  accessed  by a
        station is uniquely id-entified by a specific DID.


        All  messages  (except  no-traffic)  contain  the  3-character  address
        symbolized  by RID  SID DID  immediately following  the start-of-header
        (SOH) character.


        A poll group is defined as all stations on the communications line that
        recog-nize the RID and SID of  a poll message.  Each station in  such a
        group will recognize a general RID as its RID address and a general SID
        as its SID address.  A  poll containing a general RID, general  SID and
        general DID is called a general poll.  Another form of general  poll is
        one containing a specific RID, general a specific RID, general  SID and
        general DID.


        A  poll containing  a specific  RID, specific  SID and  general  DID is
        called a specific poll.


        A typical UTS 40 with screen-bypass would be assigned 2 SIDS.   All the
        stations in a poll group addressed by a general poll are  candidates to
        furnish the response.  A UTS 40 with screen-bypass performs  a function
        similar to  that of  the terminal multiplexer  in terms  of determining
        priority of response between the station and the screen-bypass memory.


        No two drops on a multidrop line can be members of the same poll group,
        since both drops would try to respond at once because there is no means
        to resolve the contention for  the line.  Note however, that  more than
        one  poll  group may  be  associated with  a  terminal  multiplexer (if
        multiple RIDs are assigned) Hence, providing multiple poll groups  at a
        physical drop.

        Original Question by : Rajib Sarmah, Tymnet Communications Consultant
                 Response by : Norman Chin, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                        Date : January 05, 1987






        1. What's the difference between the "HOME" key and the "HOME CURSOR" 
           key?

           The difference between a "HOME" function and a "HOME CURSOR" 
           function is that "HOME" takes the user to the first unprotected 
           position on the screen while "HOME CURSOR" takes you to the first 
           position, protected or not.

        2. Is there a "HOME" key defined for TTY type terminals? If not, how is
           cursor movement achieved?

           The "HOME" key, for TTY, is defined as an "ESC H" or "ESC h".

        3. To be able to use the "PA1", "PA2", etc. keys, is it necessary to 
           define system request keys in the CMT slot?  What version of SNA 
           supports that function?

           It is not required to define a system request key for your terminal
           when you are creating new terminal macros; However, I do not see 
           how defining or not defining it will affect the use of the PA keys. 

           Both SNA 1.06 and 2.01 support the "system request" key.

        Can you  please clarify  the following  from the  release documentation
        file PRB35.Y04.  What is the actual macro name, or are there two (NDLOG
        or/and NDESC)?
        *

                           .
                           .
                By default, this data is logged every 30 minutes, but this 
                can be altered via the NDLOG macro in the tymfile.  The 
                format is:
                
                    NDLOG(m)
                
                where "m" is the number of minutes between log entries.  For
                example, "NDESC(10)" would cause the data to be logged every 10
                minutes.  Also, this log message can be disabled by specifying
                "NDESC(0)".

        Probe Log Messages You Can Control                     January 28, 1987


        The macro name  in question is NDLOG.   The references to NDESC  in the
        PRB35.Y04 file are incorrect.  I  am attaching some more info  on which
        Probe log messages you can control.

        =======================================================================
        NDLOG(n)    this controls the frequency, in minutes, of message type
                    390.  This message is to help keep track of node descriptor
                    space and looks like:

                    NODE DESCRIPTORS:
                      ACTIVE: ____    RESERVED: ____            EXPIRED: __
                      COMPACTIONS: _  ACCUM TIME: _.___ (SEC)   FREE SPACE: __%

                    to turn this display off entirely, try NDLOG(0).

        MSGLOG      this is an equate statement which defaults on and can be
                    turned off with MSGLOG EQ 0.  This parameter controls the
                    display of messages 358 and 360.

                    #358 looks like:

                    AVERAGE QUEUE SIZE.    INPUT: __   OUTPUT: __

                    #360 is controlled by some message table flags which can
                    be set through DDT and all default off.  It look like:

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        CUSTOMER CALLED TO  INDICATE THAT THE DISPLAY  TIME STAMP WAS  1/2 HOUR
        OFF AND WAS NOT  UPDATING ON A REGULAR  BASIS.  NEXT TO THE  TIME STAMP
        WAS  A NEGATIVE  NUMBER THAT  APPEARED TO  INCREMENT WHILE  THE DISPLAY
        COMMAND WAS ISSUED REPEATEDLY.

        THE PROBLEM APPEARED TO HAVE CLEARED ITSELF.  WAS THIS DUE TO A CIRCUIT
        TO PROBE GETTING ZAPPED OR PERHAPS THE TMCS DISK GOING OFFLINE?  SHOULD
        THERE NOT HAVE BEEN AN ERROR MESSAGE TO INDICATE AN ANOMALY?  WHAT DOES
        THE INCREMENTING NEGATIVE NUMBER DO?   DOES IT COUNT OFF THE  NUMBER OF
        SECONDS THAT THE DISPLAY FUNCTION HAS NOT BEEN REFRESHED BY ANY CHANCE?






        RESPONSE:


        TMCS DISPLAY  information is  updated by  the circuit,  to NEM,  at the
        interval set by  the SET DISPLAY command  (default is 120  seconds).  A
        negative  number in  the time  stamp means  the number  of  seconds the
        display is behind  the most current  information (if greater  than five
        minutes).   An  increased  negative number  counts  the  time  that the
        display has not been updated since the last interval set.

        The main cause for the TMCS display being delayed, is  network traffic.

        When Display Time-Stamp is Off                         January 28, 1987


        TMCS DISPLAY can usually catch  up and the negative number in  the time
        stamp clears when the traffic is slow, e.x., at night.  This is  not an
        anomaly.  The negative  number in the time  stamp is the  indication of
        the delay, consequently, there should not be an error message reported.




        The following is an OnTyme  from NTD which has more inforamtion  on the
        negative number in the Display command:




        Another  cause for  the negative  number in  the Display  command  is a
        network with no activity. The time in the Display command header is the
        time of the last message received. The Display command is  only reading
        the following events

            event 6      lost node
            event 8.29   report node resources: links on used lines
            event 19     link status on tymnet-II node
            event 32     host status
            event 43     link unshut
            event 47     line unshut
            event 54     end of takeover
            event 58     sync port request response
            event 74     log circuit length message


        If the network is functioning without problems, none of these messages,
        except event 74, will be  received and the Display command  will appear
        to be behind. Event 74  is only sent if requested in  Supervisor systen
        generation.

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        CUSTOMER HAS SOME  GENERAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING PHYSICAL  INTERFACE FOR
        RJE INTERFACE, SPECIFICALLY 3780:

        1. CAN 2780/3780 RUN  ON ANY SYNC PORT  OR ARE THEY RESTRICTED  TO NON-
        PRIMITIVE PORTS? (2,3,6,7,ETC.)

        2. HOW IS THE RTS SIGNALLING AFFECTED BY WHETHER THE PORT  IS PRIMITIVE
        OR NON-PRIMITIVE (IF PRIMITIVE IS ALLOWABLE).

        3.  HOW IS  RTS SIGNALLING  AFFECTED  BY WHETHER  THE PORT  IS  HOST OR
        TERMINAL, SWITCHED OR LEASED, AND THE SETTING OF THE "BRTS" PARAMETER.






        RESPONSE:


        1.  The  Engine  Sync  board provides  two  kinds  of  ports  which are
        Primitive  ports  and  Non-Primitive  (also  called  BSC   ports).  The
        difference between  these two  types is  that the  former ones  have no
        modem control  signals. These  signals are  DTR, DSR,  RTS, and  CTS. I
        would suggest  you use non-primitive  ports because these  signals will
        usually be utilized one way or another. If the customer has a  need for
        these signals, then just arrange the proper macros in the tymfile.

        SYNC Ports and Signaling                               January 28, 1987


        2.  Since  primitive  ports  do  not  support  RTS,  half-duplex modems
        (require RTS/CTS handshaking) can not be used. Full-duplex  (no RTS/CTS
        handshake required) is OK.


        3. RTS has nothing to do with whether the port is terminal or host.  If
        RTS/CTS handshaking is required, then the sender will raise  RTS first,
        prior to  transmitting data, and  wait for CTS  high (raised  by modem)
        indicating that receiver is ready to receive data. But before  data can
        be  XMTed and  RCVed back  and forth,  there must  already  be physical
        connections.  Switched  lines use  DTR and  DSR signals  to set  up the
        connections.  Only switched lines can have dial-up access. Non-switched
        (leased) connections do not  use DTR/DSR. So switched, or  not, depends
        on if you  need to play DTR/DSR  handhake to make the  connections. RTS
        has  nothing  to do  with  it either.   BBXS  defaults so  that  RTS is
        required whether you are host/terminal ports or  leased/switched lines.
        So if the  customer does not need  RTS/CTS handshake, then you  can use
        BRTS option with value 0, to disable it.

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:

        What are the reasons behind a Super hang-up message when expecting a B6
        from slot 0 ?






        RESPONSE:

        The following is a description of Superhang messages and when  they are
        sent:

        Host interface slots may send Hang and Superhang  messages   when  they
        want  to  disconnect  the  user's terminal from the Tymsat  and require
        that the user dial again (or reconnect the  terminal  if   a  hardwired
        connection).   When this is done,  it is common to send a  text message
        to the user to explain why.  The proper way for the slot to do  this is
        to  first  send  a Superhang message,  then the text,  and then  a Hang
        message.   The reason is that on half duplex terminals it may   not  be
        possible  to send the text because the terminal is not in  the "output"
        mode, but you do not want the hang-up operation to wait until  the user
        gets around to allowing the terminal to output,  so the  Superhang mes-
        sage tells the Tymsat to hang the terminal immediately if it is  a half
        duplex terminal (without printing the message, not nice, but  what else
        can you do?).   The Superhang message is ignored for full  duplex  ter-
        minals and the Hang message tells the Tymsat to hang the terminal.

        Description of Superhang Messages                      January 28, 1987


        Terminal  interface  slots  should  only  receive  Hang   and Superhang
        messages.   They need to do something equivalent  to   the  description
        above  for  the Tymsat on whatever terminal they are  interfacing.   In
        addition,  it is very important that they respond to a  Hang   (or  un-
        ignored  Superhang) with a Zapper message.   The Hang message  does not
        tear down the circuit, it only hangs up the terminal.   It  is expected
        that a Zapper will be sent back to tear down the circuit.   If  this is
        not done, the circuit will continue to tie up resources,   the account-
        ing will not be closed, and related hardships will result.

        During assembly,  two timers  will be checked  to see  if they  are set
        adequately or not:

        1) Receive timer -- its corresponding macro is REPLYTO and the default
                            value is 3 seconds.

        2) Transmit timer --  Its corresponding macro is LOPTION(l#,TXR., t) 
                              where l# is line number and t is the transmit 
                              timout value in seconds. The default value is 
                              3 seconds.


        The proper way to calculate these two timers is the following:
                Timer = (framesize*(Windowsize+1))/(speed/8)


        In your case, receive and transmit timers will be like this:
                Timer = ((270*(7=1))/(2400/8) = 6.3  or 7 seconds.


        If these two timers are specified less than it should be, the interface
        will give out warning message -- INCONSISTENT DEFINITION ON  TIMERS AND
        SPEED.

        The reason why  the host drops DTR  after receiving UA is  unclear. You
        need to  verify if the  UA goes  into host with  the correct  format. A
        correct SDLC frame with control code of UA will be like this:

          **byte 1 -- 7E, flag
          **byte 2 -- C1, SDLC station address
          **byte 3 -- 73, SDLC command for UA

          **byte 4,5- checksum

        It will also  be very interesting to  see whether the  same environment
        running in  native mode or  not. If  the SNA HIF  sends out  valid SDLC
        frames and all the proper signals are provided by our ENGINE, then most
        likely the problem is either at the cable or the customer site.

        Sense Status Messages for the 3270 Interfaces          January 28, 1987






                  14 -  Sense Status Messages for the 3270 Interfaces







        Original Question by : Dayna Meyer, Tymnet Communications Consultant
                 Response by : Tod Fiste, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                        Date : January, 1987







        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        My customer wants to verify  the exact manner in which  Tymnet supports
        the sense  status messages for  the 3270 interfaces.   Specifically, we
        would like to know what would  happen in the case of the CU  being lost
        during  a  session  at  both  the  pbt  and  pbh.   They  are generally
        configured as native mode with pvc's.






        RESPONSE:


        Two different  Sense Status  messages are  sent to  the host  under two
        different conditions. When a device is being logged on, the  PBTI sends
        SS of Device  End (C240) to  the PBHI. Once the  PBHI knows there  is a
        circuit, it sends the Device End to the host. The second instance would
        occur  if the  host were  to send  a select  to a  device for  which no
        circuit is built (as when the CU has been lost, per your  question). We
        would send  an RVI  so that  the host  would send  us a  specific poll,
        allowing us  to send SS  of Intervention Required  (4050). We  will not
        send an Intervention  Required message in  response to a  general poll.
        All SS messages received from the CU are simply passed on to the host.

        Now that version 5.10 is in full release and 5.06 is leaving support, I
        would like to  remind all you 'private-netters'  that a 5.10 node  in a
        network with version 41.01 or older sup must have the  parameter OLDSUP
        EQ 1 in the .TYM file.


        If you  do not include  this you  will see all  sorts of  complaints on
        trying to bring the 5.10 node  into the net.  There will be  probe msgs
        indicating Invalid Sup  Msg type 1A and  you will also see  Invalid Sup
        Msg in TMCS.


        The 1A  is important  since it  is the new  msg type  for the  new host
        status message.  The Oldsups can only handle type 11.  So, if  you have
        just upgraded and see complaints with 1A's in them, this is most likely
        your problem.


        This has been discussed in section D.4 of (Baseline)Tii05.Y10.

              17 -  Tymnet I2G1 Gateway Still Supported Under ISIS V 7.00







        Original Question by : Marcia Hopkins, Tymnet Communications Consultant
                 Respones by : Gail Bubsey, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                        Date : January 26, 1987







        ORIGINAL QUESTION :


        IS THE TYMNET I2G1 GATEWAY  STILL SUPPORTED UNDER ISIS V. 7.00  AND TII
        V. 5.10?  THE ISIS.INF DOCUMENT INDICATES THAT "TYMNET-I" IS  NO LONGER
        SUPPORTED--TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THIS APPLY?






        RESPONSE :


        The reference to  T1 not being supported  means that you can  no longer
        configure  a  node to  run  as Tymnet  I  under this  version  of Isis,
        something I doubt anyone has been doing anyway.


        A few words  to the wise:   by using the  sample .tym file  for version
        7.00, I have found that you do need to include either TII EQ 1  or ISIS
        EQ 1 in your .tym  file or else node code  does not seem to be  able to
        figure out that this is an Isis node.


        Second, since the parameter CONSAT is no longer used, if your  good guy
        list has the option  IF CONSAT EQ 1 in  it, you will get an  error.  If
        you want  to keep that  username in  the good guy  list, I  suggest you
        either include it  all the time,  or do an if  on NASYNG or  some other
        async parameter.

        Third, the memory requirements have been corrected for this  version so
        that you  can have  your gen total  1024k instead  of 1020k.   The boot
        option is now taken into account for this calculation.

                        Date : January 26, 1987







        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        With the KS command in Xray we are seeing the HWM for the Physical Link
        Characters as high as  1216 on a 9.6  link.  This converts to  9728 bps
        (1216 x 8) which is 100+% utilization of the line.  Would like  to know
        how this  is possible (or  if we are  figuring this  incorrectly).  The
        link does show saturated.






        RESPONSE:


        One possible explanation  that I was given  for this phenomena  is that
        these fields are averages of  60 samples taken over one minute.   It is
        possible that on  occasion, instead of  adding together 60  samples and
        dividing by 60, we  get 61 samples and  divide by 60.  This  would skew
        the average slightly as you are seeing.

        Written by : Paul Chu, Mgr. NTD Async/Consat Support
              Date : January 20, 1987







        The current implementations of CONSAT do not support the  hardware flow
        control by the RTS/CTS signalling, so the signals are useless.


        TYMCOM  betatest  release  2.06  supports  flow  control  to  the  host
        direction by crossing pin 25 on the TYMCOM side to the host side on the
        CTS pin.


        TYMCOM, whenever it  is busy, lowers the  BUSY pin to flow  control the
        host from sending more data.  However, TYMCOM does not look at  the CTS
        pin from  the host.   Host must use  the XON/XOFF  to flow  control the
        TYMCOM.


        The flow control  is limited by the  hardware and the driver  to handle
        the signalling.

        ****************************************************************
         
                      HOW MANY DEVICES CAN A SNA/CMT SUPPORT?
         
        ****************************************************************

        Many of you have expressed  concern that our SNA/CMT product  cannot be
        configured for  one-to-one security  addressing for  a large  number of
        users  without  ordering multiple  interfaces.   We plan  to  have some
        solutions available to this problem in 1987.


        At the present time, a Beta Test is being conducted on a  special patch
        that may allow more  devices to be loaded  into a single SNA  slot.  If
        this test is successful I will announce new guidelines for you  to use;
        IN THE MEANTIME, you must follow the following guidelines or your order
        will be  placed on hold  and/or your escalations  to QSATS will  not be
        worked on  unless you have  prior Beta Test  approval thru  the regular
        channels.


        Use :EXEC *** BETA.REQUEST if you have a customer who would like  to be
        a Beta Site for this patch.

        GUIDELINES FOR ORDERING SNA/CMT


        A standard  SNA/CMT can  be loaded into  an Engine  to handle  about 45
        devices depending upon the  configuration.  This means you can  have up
        to 45 CRT's without printer (DON'T FORGET RESPONSE TIME ON  THE NETWORK
        CONNECTION) or about 23 users if they use CRT's and printers.   You can
        use the information in  *** SNA/CMT.SIZE to help figure  your customers
        configuration.

        Beta Test of SNA/CMT                                   January 28, 1987


        A special configuration that runs the CMT on a MicroEngine hardwired to
        the Engine with SNA  can support about 75 devices.   This configuration
        should only be used when a customer requires One-to-one  addressing for
        Security or because they are using CRT's and Printer.  And remember, to
        figure  the  number  of simultaneous  users  your  customer  expects to
        correspond to  the kind  of Response  Time they  want.  Most  3270 full
        screen applicatons  handle somewhere between  10 (heavy traffic)  to 32
        (light  traffic) simultaneous  users before  the response  time  on the
        Network Connection begins to be impacted.
