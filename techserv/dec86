                        3 -  Elimination of Pseudo Host Numbers







        Written by : Cynthia Urroz
              Date : November 4, 1986







        With the new  release of Supervisor code  (version 43 planned  for mid-
        87),  the  "accounting host  number"  or pseudo  host  number  used for
        origination hosts will be dropped.

        The pseudo host  number was used as  the requesting host number  in the
        pseudo-needle  request message.  Deletion of  this "account  only" host
        number means that  the real host number  may be used as  the requesting
        host number (as well as the destination host number).

        REMEMBER: THE ORIGINATING INTERFACE MUST REPORT THIS HOST NUMBER TO THE
        NODE CODE WITH SOME STATUS (eg. SHUT).

        Please  be informed  that before  mid-87, all  customer  async terminal
        interface applications will have to be re-genned to re-place the pseudo
        host number with the real  host number. This will also be  required  on
        all MDC Async TIFs as well.

        Communications  Consultants will  be  reqired to  re-generate  all slot
        codes  involved.  The  Account Representatives  can  enter  HOST NUMBER
        ORDERS  only  to  move  the  process.   Network  Engineering   will  be
        responsible for changing all network consats.

        It is not too soon to begin coordinating the accounts involved.

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        MY  QUESTION  CONCERNS  PARITY  on  the  network   tymsats/consats  and
        terminals set at 8 data bits, no parity.  I have had  several customers
        complain that when they are using PC's set at 8/none, the  entire logon
        sequence is garbage.

        I understand the fact that TYMNET outputs at default  7bits/mark parity
        and thus smart  terminals will recognize  the characters with  the HIGH
        BIT  set as  the upper  group of  ASCII characters  (usually graphics).
        Usually  once  the  terminal  is connected  to  the  host,  all  of the
        "garbage" problems go away.

        However, I'm beginning to run  into situations where this is  not true.
        Users who access several systems (over several networks) will set their
        terminals at 8/none and wish to leave the settings this way.   The host
        systems doesn't use the upper group of ASCII and the  network continues
        to transmit at 7/mark.

        It's beginning to be an  urgent issue........ is there some way  to get
        the network tymsat/consat to drop to NO PARITY?  Does Ctrl-P help?

        With Consat 3.05, a user has a choice of receiving data from the Consat
        in 7  bits/ save  parity or 7  bits/ even  parity.    Even  parity will
        still mark the high order  bit depending on the bits in  the character.
        Sounds like what is needed is 7 bits/ space parity.  This  is available
        with Consat 6.01 (betatest) using the 'O' TID.

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:

        USING THE 'COM' WITH CMT I HAVE PROBLEMS :

        1)  THE  CMD 'USER '  PLUS A VALIDATED  USERNAME FOR CMT  OR A  RPORT #
        RECEIVED FROM THE PORTS CMD.  WILL NOT WORK.

        2)  THE 'MENU'  GIVES ME THE SAME  RESPONSE AS ABOVE ,  NOTHING HAPPENS
        WHEN I ENTER IN THE CMD.

        3)  WHILE OUTPUTTING THE RINGS  A PORT # AFTER THE IRING,  ORING, RINGS
        CMD, WILL GIVE ME NO RESPONSE.  ALSO THE 'A/' WILL NOT STOP  THE OUTPUT
        TO THE TERMINAL.






        RESPONSE:


        The problems that you  encountered are caused by a  misunderstanding of
        how NAD works.  When you use the "::" command, a "string of  text" will
        be transmitted to the slot up to and including the first occurance of a
        blank, comma, or carriage  return.  So when you typed  "::RINGS 5<cr>",
        only "RINGS " is transmitted to COM.  COM will wait until  a subsequent
        carriage  return  or  other  characters  for  the  parameters  to begin
        execution of the command.  To use the "::" command in NAD, you  need to
        type "::RINGS  <cr>" followed by  a "::5<cr>" for port 5.   <cr> stands
        for hitting  a single  carriage return.   Note that  you need  2 spaces


                                           8                         MMDDYY.TIP

        following the command  RINGS.  For some  reason, NAD does  not transmit
        the last space character.   Another  way is to put NAD in  a text-relay
        mode by  typing a "%R".   With this command,  all characters  typed are
        transmitted  without  any  inspection by  NAD.   So  like  the previous
        example, you would need to type "%R<cr>" followed by "RINGS  5<cr>" for
        the command to work.  Hitting a  single escape key will get you  out of
        the text-relay mode.  This command  saves you the time in  entering the
        two colons.   The only real problem with COM is using the MENU command.
        It causes an illegal memory reference in the slot but there  is already
        a patch to fix this problem.  An NSR has already been submitted  and it
        will be incorporated in the code.

        Latest Release of 2.06 and 3.00 Patch Files           November 25, 1986






                   7 -  Latest Release of 2.06 and 3.00 Patch Files







        Written by : Norman Chin, HQ Network Staff Consultant
              Date : November 18, 1986






        The latest release of CMTI P  file, for version 2.06 and 3.00,  are now
        in system 33 and 39.  It  will be released to other systems  within the
        next 24 hours.  However, if you are planning to gen the CMTI codes with
        the lastest patches on systems other  than 33 or 39, please be  sure to
        check the checksum of the P file to be certain that you have the latest
        one on  that system.  The  checksum value of  CMTI02.P06 is  DULJOH and
        CMTI03.P00 is GUQBIB.


        Because of the amount of memory needed to fit all the patches, you need
        to expand the patch area  size by adding a couple of  equate statements
        in your tymfile.  The equate statements for version 2.06 are:
                        PHSIZE EQ  300
                        P1SIZE EQ  500
        For version 3.00:
                        PHSIZE EQ  200


        For version 2.06, the P file include the following patches which should
        be taken out when assembling with  the source P file if you  still have
        them:

          APLTBL.PAT, CLROW6.PAT, ODLOOP.PAT, LEEOF.PAT, EDMLP.PAT (EDMLP.P06)
          RESET.PAT, MANUAL.PAT, REMOD.PAT, WCCETX.PAT, ABORT.PAT
          B107XX.PAT, NSR509.P06, CFLDINIT.PAT, SPC.PAT

        For version 3.00:

          SPC.PAT, MANUAL.PAT, WCCETX.PAT, B107XX.PAT, EDMLP.PAT, RDMOD.PAT
          BORT.PAT, NSR509.P06, CFLDINIT.PAT
          Also, patches APLTBL.PAT, CLROW6.PAT, ODLOOP.PAT and LEEOF.PAT are
          no longer needed for this version since it's already fixed in the
          R file.

        ATC Status - Limited Release                          November 25, 1986






                           8 -  ATC Status - Limited Release







        Written by : Rourke McCusker, Product Marketing
              Date : November 19, 1986



        THE ATC IS NOW IN LIMITED RELEASE.

        Beta  testing of  PROM Version  1.26 has  been  successfully completed,
        allowing  the  ATC  to  go  to  limited  release.   Manufacturing  will
        incorporate this new PROM version in all ATC orders.

        It is necessary  to fill out a  Limited Release Form before  orders for
        the ATC will  be processed.  The form  can be easily  completed through
        Ontyme by invoking  "EXEC *** LIMITED.REQUEST".  This  information will
        be used for tracking purposes.

        All  currently installed  ATCs should  be using  version 1.20  or later
        PROMs.  All earlier PROM  versions must be replaced.  The  PROM version
        can  be  determined   by  performing  a  PROBE   SNAP.   Communications
        Consultants should  check all ATCs  in their areas  to verify  the PROM
        version.  Field Service Company  (FSC) can order version 1.26  PROM set
        using part number 380025-001.

        ENHANCEMENTS / CORRECTIONS

        PROM Version 1.26 implements changes to address various anomolies which
        have  been  experienced   in  different  customer   environments.   The
        following anomolies have been corrected:

        1. Port hangs when a long needle (more than 8 internodal hops) is
           received from the Supervisor.  This primarily affected international
           locations.

        2. Node number being reported incorrectly, affecting accounting data.

        3. Break key not being processed properly, causing unrecognizable
           characters.


                                          12                         MMDDYY.TIP
        ATC Status - Limited Release                          November 25, 1986


        4. After a power failure, intermittent recovery without manual
           intervention.

        5. Synchronous line retransmissions, causing delays.

        6. Not recovering when command circuit is lost.

        7. Backspace key not echoed properly in half duplex.

        8. Terminal identifier unrecognizable when asynchronous lines are
           noisy.

        9. Terminal speed unrecognizable when asynchronous terminal speed is
           marginal.

        Applications requiring  sustained input from  block mode  terminals and
        personal computers (PCs)  can be configured,  but the number  of ports,
        the  speeds, and  device  types must  be restricted  (see  the attached
        configuration guidelines).

        PROM  Version  1.26  does  support  synchronous  and  SIO  V.24 network
        connections.


        INTERNATIONAL USE

        JAPAN -  Version 1.26  supports CTL O,character  and operates  in SPACE
        parity, but  precludes it  from being  used for  applications requiring
        EVEN parity.   A Micro-Engine with  CONSAT Version 4  must be  used for
        applications needing EVEN  parity and shift  characters for 8  bit KATA
        KANA and KANJI.

        U.K. - Version 1.26 incorporates the 8 bit ASCII code handling, but the
        canned 7 bit  "please type your  terminal identifier" promt  will cause
        MDCSC  terminals  to  operate incorrectly.   The  standard  features in
        Version  1.26 and  that  of the  MDCSC terminals  and  applications are
        mutually exclusive.  This will be addressed further in a separate memo.

        The PROM based ATC cannot emulate the CONSAT software completly because
        of  the  inherent  flexibility of  the  CONSAT  Tymfiles,  which allows
        operational  characteristics  to  be  defined.   The  ATC  incorporates
        equivilant  CONSAT Tymfile  parameter  functions which  best  match the
        applications which the ATC was intended and can not be modified.

        The functions which the ATC does NOT support are:
        1. Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC).
        2. Baudot, EBCDIC, and CORRESPONDENCE codes.
        3. Addressable ports.
        4. Software downloading.
        5. Dynamic network circuit REBUILD.
        6. Multi-line links.
        7. Passthrough circuits.
        8. Split baud, 75/1200 bps.

        APPLICATION AND CONFIGURATION GUIDELINES


        To  insure  proper operation  of  the  ATC, do  NOT  exceed  the listed
        guidelines.   The ATC  can  support configurations  with as  many  as 8
        medium speed  (2.4/4.8 Kbps)  devices or as  few as  2 high  speed (9.6
        Kbps) devices.  The ATC has  limited buffer memory and tests  show that
        it is sensative to CPU interrupt and gouging levels.

        NOTE:

        The reference to "terminal" assumes asynchronous character mode devices
        used in an interactive application.  The reference to "PC"  assumes the
        asynchronous devices to be either block mode terminals or PCs emulating
        terminals  with  file  transfer  capability  (input  or  output)  using
        XON/XOFF flow control in sustained traffic applications.

        The  following application  and configurations  have  been successfully
        tested.  There is no difference in performance when synchronous  or SIO
        network links are used.

        V.1.12 SDLC Assembly Error                            November 25, 1986






                            9 -  V.1.12 SDLC Assembly Error







        Written by : John Mckiernan, HQ Network Staff Consultant
              Date : November 19, 1986







        Tymnet's SNA and SDLC  interfaces include options that attempt  to take
        advantage of  various SIO microcode  enhancements.  An example  of this
        option is the SNA 'SIOVER' macro or the SDLC 'MSIOTP' macro.

        SDLC version 1.12 and 2.02 have two possible values which can  be given
        for the macro.  They are  M.TYP0 or M.TYP1 . M.TYP0 specifies  that the
        SIO Motherboard  in use  for this  interface is  Revision Level  'D' or
        earlier.   Using M.TYP1  specifies that  the Revision  Level is  'E' or
        later.  It is VERY important to assure the the SIO microcode  PROM's on
        SIO Motherboard agree with  this option.  Incorrect use of  this option
        will generally lead  to interfaces which do  not receive data  from the
        attached line.

        When using  V1.12 SDLC  software with the  'M.TYP0' option  defined, an
        assembly error such as the following, will be seen.

          XSET75

          Some disp. fld expressions using this label def. are out of range

        Elimination of this error would  require a direct update of  the SOURCE
        code, which  cannot be  done unless  the product  is in  ALPHATEST.  As
        such, the problem  is now corrected via  a patch which was  released to
        SOURCE .  That patch is dated Mar. 27, 1986 and will generate a message
        such as

          PATCH added on 860327 at 1500 by ACH.
               Starts at XSET60+12 and is 6x bytes long
                  Continues at PATCH1+0 and is 12x bytes long
          <<< PATCH FOR OLD MICROCODE >>>

        V.1.12 SDLC Assembly Error                            November 25, 1986


        If the first warning message is observed, it can be ignored as  long as
        the second message is also seen.  The next SOURCE release of  the PATCH
        file will provide an explicit note to that effect.

        Please  note  that  this  problem is  corrected  in  Version  2.02 SDLC
        software, and that the problem will not be seen when using the 'M.TYP1'
        option in Version 1.12 SDLC software.

                All  testing  was independently conducted  within  NTD, 
                marketing,  at  DEC  and  at  MDIPC  with  similar  end 
                results.  (i.e.  50%  improvement  in  X.25).  Internal 
                marketing  testing  was conducted using ISIS  5.08  and 
                Node Code 5.06.   Measurements were taken using  XRAY's 
                NS  (Node  Status) command by comparing exec count  and 
                total  CPS  count and the KS (Link Status)  command  by 
                comparing Logical and Physical Link Character counts.
         
                For inter-slot communication measurements,  DDT's  ?CPS 
                (CPS rates thru dispatcher) command was used.

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:

        For the setting of a lab,  i.e starting up a new network and  not using
        the un2 switch  to have the un2  username automatically created  by the
        Sup, you face the problem to create a username to first  access NETVAL.
        This could  be done  manually using  utility if  you know  the relative
        address corresponding to the username you are creating.   The parameter
        :MAX_CUD_BLOCK that may  vary is part of  the hashing algorithm  so for
        certain values you can't use  the get command of an existing  netval in
        an another network.

        Q:  What is  the formula  to go  from the  ascii representation  of the
        username to go to the block number?





        RESPONSE:

        Here are  the three  algorithms in  the moniter  cud_entry_updater that
        assigns a cud block.  If you want to find the value of the rest  of the
        parameters, just look at the listing.

        This is a description of some functions and processes used in the three
        algorithms.

        maximum_cud_block= 2039 'This is a tymfile switch'.

        get_next_name_character= This process takes characters of a username 
                                 and moves them into name_char.

        name_word= Is a 4 character array.

        next_name_word= Takes the hex vaules of a username and converts them to
                        a decimal number.  The decimal value is moved into the
                        local variable sum in the hashed_block process.
                       
        name_pointer= This pointer points to the next character to be processed
                      in the username_text_index

        MOD= Is a pascal operator that returns the remainder.

        bit7= 16777216 This value is set in the source code.

        name= Is a username to be processed. 'Netpriv' will be used as an

        Original Question by: Dave Gaetani, Field CC
                 Response by : Gail Bubsey, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                       Date : November 24, 1986






        Circuit paths are chosen based on cost.  The cost of a  particular link
        is dependent  upon its speed,  degree of overloading,  and the  type of
        link it  is (terr  vs. sat)  as opposed to  the type  of traffic  to be
        routed over it (interactive vs. batch).

        The "type of traffic" of a particular circuit is based on its  CCT.  To
        oversimplify, most  async traffic is  considered interactive,  and most
        sync  is considered  batch.   A listing  of CCTs  and  their associated
        service type can be found in CIRCUIT.DOC.

        The CCT assigned  for a particular circuit  is dependent either  on the
        TID you enter at your terminal or by the CCT assigned by  the interface
        itself.  As an example, the 3270tif assigns a CCT of 17 to the circuits
        that it builds - batch, sync, polled terminals.

        The use of control characters  at login allows you to override  some of
        the CCT characteristics - ^a through ^d for gouging level, ^h for half-
        duplex, etc.  Some interfaces allow the use of these control characters
        in their "canned" logon strings and some do not.  I  suggest contacting
        the particular interface group in question to find out its  default CCT
        and what overrides it allows.

        Q - I understand control  L at logon will force traffic  over satellite
        links with newer releases of Supervisor software.  What versions of SUP
        support this?  Are there any other versions necessary to  support this?
        Ie. Node Code, Isis, etc.

        A -  the control character  to override an  interactive CCT to  use the
        batch path costing is  ^V not ^L.  In  reverse to make a  batch circuit
        appear interactive, use ^I.  Sup v.41.04  has a bug fix for the  use of
        ^V.   Isis  and  Nodecode  don't look  at  these  characters,  and each


                                          24                         MMDDYY.TIP

        interface has its own way  of dealing with them.  Again I  suggest that
        you contact the particular group in question.




        Q - Explain how this works:  What if there is a least  cost terrestrial
        path, will the  Sup choose this  over the SAT  path even though  ^L was
        issued?  Is there anything dynamic about this scheme?

        A - The  way a path's cost  is affect by the  type of traffic  is quite
        dramatic.  If the traffic type  is batch, each non-SAT link in  a patch
        gets 31x added to its cost, total cost for a path is the sum of all the
        link costs.  The reverse is true for interactive traffic  over non-TERR
        links (TERR  and SAT are  defined in the  TIILNK statement in  the .TYM
        file), 31x is added to the  original cost of a satellite link  for this
        type of traffic.

        Note that the lowest cost path  will always be chosen.  In the  case of
        batch  traffic,  if  despite  the  penalties  there  is  a  cheaper all
        terrestrial path to be taken, that is the route that will  be assigned.
        If there was a SAT link that was unavailable at the time of the circuit
        build that later  becomes available, there  is no way  of "dynamically"
        noticing that and changing the  circuit path.  The circuit has  to come
        down and be re-costed and re-built.




        Q - What  additional cost if  any does satellite add  to a 9.6  or 56kb
        circuit?

        A - The link cost for circuit speeds remains constant - 4.8 =  17x, 9.6
        = 11x, 14.4 = 10x, 19.2 = 0Fx, 56 = 0Dx, MS = 0Cx.  Add to this  18x if
        the circuit is one-way overloaded  or 30x if it is  two-way overloaded.
        Then comes the additional 31x if there is a traffic type mis-match.




        Q -  What is  the latest documentation  that speaks  of this  stuff and
        where can I find it?

        A - The latest thing that  I know of that talks of CCTs  is CIRCUIT.DOC
        available in (Techref:56).  I wrote an article about circuit costing in
        the August Tech Tips.




        Q - Is there any method to avoid a satellite link for interactive users
        when the SAT link is cheaper in cost other than re-engineering?
