        Original Question by : Edward Tam, Tymnet Communication's Consultant
                 Response by : Gail Bubsey, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                        Date : January 28, 1987






        ORIGINAL QUESTION :
        -----------------
           1)  How can one fine tune the DI.BFL parameter in the node code 
               tymfile?

           2)  What is the default value for the parameter DI.BFL? 

           3)  In XRAY, can the data in BS (display Bufferlet use statistics) 
               be accurate enough to act as a guildline for the DI.BFL
               parameter?  If so, how should one interpret the data from BS and
               calculate the optimal number of bufferlets that is required by a
               node?







        RESPONSE :
        --------
        1.  The parameter 'DI.BFL' is an Isis parameter specifying the number
            of dispatcher bufferlets to allocate.

        2.  The default is acheived from the following calculations:

                DI.BFL = 6 * NBUF
                NBUF = (-20)&(2 * DI.CHN + NSLOT + 21)
                DI.CHN = NDP (default)

        3.  There is nothing in the Xray displays that would give you 
            information for setting this parameter.  You could set it by hand

                                           1
        Status of Nodecode DI.BFL Parameter                   February 18, 1987


            in the .tym file, but it would be safer to influence its value by
            finetuning the number of dispatcher ports.  The default is 256d.
            A minimum value would be # of origination ports on the node + # of
            destination ports, the sum of this rounded up to the next multiple
            of 32d.  I can not think of any reason you would really want to 
            play with this unless you were extremely low on core.

        Original Question by : Elaine Espouy, TNSC
                 Response by : Adela Lee, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                        Date : January 30, 1987






        ORIGINAL QUESTION :
        -----------------

        This is in regards to the timer RETRIES on the HOST interface side. . .


        In the documentation, it mentions  that if the hif does not  receive UA
        (after the  sending of snrm  to the  TIF) before the  end of  the timer
        (netreplyto),  the  counter  retries  is  decremented  then   the  host
        interface waits again for an answer from the tif.


        In the code, it does not seem to react exactly like this: If the  Ua is
        not received before the  end of netreplyto, the counter  is decremented
        but the interface does  not wait anymore for a  UA from the tif  but it
        goes to see if something is received on host line.


        Could you explain how the  retries counter works on the  host interface
        side.






        RESPONSE :
        --------

        Only the first argument of RETRIES  is used in the HIF.  It  counts the
        number of SNRMs ignored from the host in between SNRMs sent  across the


                                           4
        Retries Counter on Host Interface                     February 18, 1987


        network.  With RETRIES defined as (5,0,0) at HIF, the HIF will send one
        SNRM to  the network for  every other 5  SNRMs received from  the host.
        This is to avoid too many unnecessary SNRMs to absorb the  command list
        and to relieve  the network traffic  as well.  The  same implementation
        applies for XID and TEST frames.


        Your observation  is absolutely correct  in that after  NETREPLYTO gets
        expired and  RETRIES counter gets  decremented in HSOP14,  the protocol
        handler goes to do receiving rather than transmitting.  In both ERS and
        SGN documents, there  exists an error  which states "When  this counter
        (RETRIES) reaches 0, HIF stops looking for a response and goes  back to
        the  start of  NDM."  According  to our  current design,  the  HIF will
        always jump from transmitting to receiving state each time when RETRIES
        counter gets decremented by one regardless if RETRIES reaches 0 or not.
        Thanks for pointing this out and  I will inform NTD to make  the proper
        change on the next release.

                          5 -  Basics of the UTS 40 Terminal







        Written by : John Burrough, HQ Network Staff Consultant
              Date : February 04, 1987







        The  UTS  40  is  an  intelligent,  programmable,  microprocessor-based
        display  terminal  used  for  interactive  communications  with  a host
        processing system.  Interface to a host is accomplished by means  of an
        EIA RS-232C synchronous communications interface which operates in half
        duplex mode at line rates up to 9600 bits per second.  A direct connect
        interface  capability is  provided for  distances up  to 200  feet.  An
        optional 8-bit peripheral interface is also available that  supports up
        to four peripheral devices.


        Data for display is transferred to the cathode ray tube (CRT)  from the
        key-board  interface,  the   communications  interface,  or   from  the
        peripherals through the peripheral interface.


        The operational  mode of the  UTS 40 is  predetermined and stored  in a
        cartridge that is easily inserted  into the back of the  terminal.  For
        instance, the  UTS 40 can  be made to  look like an  older model  CRT -
        i.e., the UTS 400.


        UTS 40 operating  parameters, as well as  transmission characteristics,
        can  be selected  by an  operator using  the "control  page",  a 2-line
        display described  below.  This  is similar in  concept to  the "setup"
        parameters  of  a  VT100.  The  parameters  are  stored  in nonvolatile
        random-access memory (RAM) and need not be re-entered each time the UTS
        40 is turned on and off.


        An 8K buffer memory, a standard feature of the UTS 40, allows  the host
        to bypass the displayed screen memory.  By entering data in  the buffer


                                           7
        Basics of the UTS 40 Terminal                         February 18, 1987


        memory,  the  host  can communicate  with  UTS  40  peripherals without
        disturbing the display screen or the entry of data (however, the screen
        bypass memory contents can be displayed by pressing the DISP  1-2 key).
        Since the UTS 40 peripheral interface allows concurrent  operation, the
        screen bypass memory can  be used to perform 2  simultaneous peripheral
        operations.


        The  screen  bypass also  enables  us to  use  the crt  as  a data-comm
        monitor, as will be described  below.  This is incredibly useful  to us
        here at headquarters.


        You can also  program this terminal.  Using  COBOL!!!!!  Unfortunately,
        that added expense to an already-fairly-expensive terminal -  hence, it
        was never a big money-maker for Sperry.  None of our customers use this
        feature.


        You can hook up all kinds of terminals to the back of a Sperry terminal
        - they are all linked together in a daisy chain fashion.  You  can hook
        up cassettes, diskettes, printers and a magnetic stripe reader.   Up to
        4 peripherals can be connected to a Sperry terminal at a time.


        There  is  also an  optional  loadable character  set  feature  for the
        terminal - but this requires an extra board.


        When the uts 40 comes  on, it runs an internal diagnostic.   Of course,
        what terminal doesn't.  It also keeps an internal log of  various error
        conditions, but I have never had any reason to look at that.


        The Sperry has an unbelievably  good line monitor built right  into it,
        it is  just amazing.   The terminal  itself is  ergonometircally fairly
        nice.  The keyboard  is fairly heavy, but  this terminal is at  least 6
        years old, so this is to be expected.


        It is an "editing"  keyboard, so you have  all kinds of keys  to delete
        characters, insert lines,  etc.  You can  also generate a  whole screen
        definition (i.e.,  this field  is protected,  this one  is unprotected,
        this one allows numeric right-justified only, etc...).


        Basically, you could say that the UTS 40 system is quite similar to the
        IBM  3270 system,  with  certain qualifications.   The UTS  40  is more
        advanced in functionality  than the 3270.  The  communications protocal
        used on  the Univac systems  is much more  complicated than  3270 comm.
        protocal.  (A big part of the complication is this:  Univac sends ACK's
        back  in the  same message  as another  message -  like   a "piggyback"

        situation - sounds like a great idea, doesn't it?  Too bad it turns the
        Univac protocal into a com plicated mess).


        Also,  IBM   (originally)  put  all   their  intelligence   into  their
        controllers, which  are basically boxes  connected to dumb  crt's.  The
        Univac  intelligence  is   in  the  terminals  themselves,   which  are
        customarily connected to the outside world via multiplexors.


        Finally, here are a few notes about the Control Page.

                  transmitted?

                  ALL - transfer all data
                  VAR - transfer all unprotedted fields
                  CHAN- transfer all changed unprotected fields.

                  We always use VAR.  You can really get screwed up if you use
                  the wrong mode.
        MM        Maintenance Mode.  This has a million functions, most of
                  which are of interest to only a few people.  However, if you 
                  type 'LM' here, one of your screens becomes a data comm-
                  monitor!  Also, the MM field is used in conjunction with the
                  PARAM field to tell the UTS 40 what peripherals it is 
                  connected to.

        PARAM     Another field with a million functions - has information very
                  similar to SETUP on a VT100 - like baud rate, keyboard click,
                  etc.  Here is also where you specify what the station's RID
                  and SID address is, a very important thing.

        If you are responsible for the re-configure of Menu Server, please read
        the attached memo from John Burke very carefully.


        The default buffer size is 80, and the maximum is 255 characters.

        ALL ANALYSTS who configure Menu  Server MUST be aware of  the follo
        problem:

            The analyst must configure the "user buffer" UBUFER to be big
            enough to hold all the strings involved in a login.  There is one
            UBUFER reserved for each simultaneous user.  Use the macro:
         
                BIGGERubuffer(nbytes)
         
            to get a UBUFER whose size is nbytes (decimal) the default size is
            80 (decimal) bytes if BIGGERubuffer is omitted.
         
            To figure the size required for UBUFER: find the COMMAND macro
            which has the most bytes in its login and match strings.  You must
            count all strings which get used during the login: c.string macros,

                                          10
        TECHALERT on Re-config of MenuService V 1.13          February 18, 1987


            c.SEEUpto macros and the other match-string macros, any rotor 
            entry, c.password, and c.username.  Then add 3 more for each macro,
            for overhead.  Then add 32 or so, to permit user typeahead before 
            the login completes.
         
            If the UBUFER is not big enough, you will CERTAINLY GET A CRASH,
            since MSV (v1 r13) does not check for overflow.
         

        I discovered this bug a few months after our section took over the Menu
        Server, and there was not time to get the fix into Release 13.   But it
        will be fixed in the next release, and people won't have to worry about
        BIGGERubuffer any more.

        PRODUCT:  TII - Nodecode

        VERSION:  5.nn

        PROBLEM:  Line data corruption may occur in a node when there are
                  DMA devices (SIO, disk, tape) and the ROM I/O board has
                  microcode version 15.

        SYMPTOM:  Node receives split or invalid character pairs on a link,
                  and then snips the link.  Check the neighbor.
                  Reference Xray manual, crypto message 39, types 01/02/03.
                 -or-
                  Node crashes upon detection of split character pairs or
                  other illegal protocol.  Check the node.
                  Reference Xray manual, crash codes 1463/1663/1A63/1C63/
                                                     2E63/5A63.

        SOLUTION:  Upgrade microcode on ROM I/O board from version 15 to 18.
                   18 is the latest version.  Also, 17 does NOT have this
                   problem.
                   ** It is estimated that there are 200 nodes in the  **
                         public network with version 15 microcode.


        NOTE:  If you have a version 15 node with symptoms other than those
               described above, please ontyme *** nodecode with a description.
               The tech alert will be updated accordingly.

        Do  you have  a prospect  or existing  customer who  has  SNA/SDLC type
        devices connected to an  international X.25 network who need  to access
        SNA Hosts  in the U.S.?   If your  answer is yes,  then our  newest IBM
        product X.25 to SDLC is just what you're looking for.


        Tymnet's X.25 to  SDLC service using  the Qualified Link  Logic Control
        (QLLC), provides network resident protocol conversion between SNA hosts
        and remote SNA/SDLC devices connected to an X.25 network.

            Highlights
         
         -  Eliminates the need to install, run and maintain NPSI on the
            IBM host.
         -  Allows quick and easy X.25-to-SDLC protocol conversion at
            minimal cost.
         -  Increases the efficiency of the Front End Processor by
            concentrating remote devices on a single host port.
         -  Supports IBM's implementation of Qualified Link Logic Control
            (QLLC).
         
            Applications
         
         -  Gives international companies the ability to connect X.25
            attached SNA terminals and PC's to the corporate mainframe.
         -  Allows 3270 and 525X terminals connected to X.25 public net-
            works access to SNA hosts without running X.25 support on the
            SNA host.  
         -  Provides a transparent Tymnet link for a wide variety of
            equipment that supports SDLC.  
         -  Enables an SNA/SDLC terminal connected to Tymnet (via SDLC
            TIF) access to an IBM host connected to a foreign X.25 net-

        Testing of New Supervisor Patch                       February 18, 1987






                         10 -  Testing of New Supervisor Patch







        Written by : Gail Bubsey, HQ Network Staff Consultant
              Date : February 16, 1987







        There  has been  an ongoing  anomaly concerning  the use  of  NOSPAS in
        supervisors of  which some of  you may be  aware.  Use of  this option,
        meant to inhibit  the building of  user circuit passthroughs  through a
        supervisor while  allowing command circuit  passthroughs, often  led to
        severe takeover problems  within the network.   Should a major  link go
        out, you would see  many "Cannot takeover xxxx through  xxxx" mesasges,
        and traces of  the command circuits  which were eventually  built would
        show strange  and unusual  paths being  taken.  The  way to  get around
        these anomalies was to simply not use the NOSPAS option.


        NTD has now written a patch for these anomalies and my problem  is that
        I am  unable to  recreate the original  takeover inconsistencies  in my
        lab.   If your  network  has experienced  this  problem or  you  have a
        network with the following qualifications and would like to help us out
        by testing this new patch, please give me a call for further details:

        Qualifications:
                1. you must be running version 41.01 of the sup.
                2. your network must have been configured so that
                   as little user passthrough traffic is likely to 
                   go through the sups as possible.
                3. the network's gateways are not directly attached
                   to the sups and are not likely to have their
                   circuits routed through the sups.
                4. the network has some off hours when this type of
                   configuration testing can be done.


        Please call me if you have  the time and inclination to help  with this
        testing.

        TO:  ALL USERS OF CONSAT 6.02--IIX CAPABILITY
             (THIS INCLUDES OUTDIAL USERS ALSO)

        RE:  POTENTIAL TO CRASH X.25 HOST INTERFACES

        PROBLEM:  WHEN USING THE CONSAT 6.02, IF THE USER TYPES AHEAD, AND IF
                  THE IIX CAPABILITY IS ON (I.E., 'NOIIX' FLAG IS OFF) THEN THE
                  X.25 SLOT MAY CRASH.

        SOLUTION: USE THE SET FLAG MACRO TO SET THE 'NOIIX' FLAG ON TO DISABLE
                  THE IIX CAPABILITY.

        NOTE:     IF THE XPAD CAPABILITY IS NEEDED, THEN CONTACT TECHNICAL
                  SERVICES TO DISCUSS ALTERNATIVES.  THE CONTACT POINT 
                  INITIALLY WILL BE MYSELF.

        New Model/Product Numbers for Engines                 February 18, 1987






                      12 -  New Model/Product Numbers for Engines







        Written by : Rourke McCusker, Product Marketing
              Date : February 18, 1987







        This memo  formally announces Tymnet's  new product numbering  plan for
        the Engine family.  Attached  are documents which explain the  plan and
        the  relationship between  generic Engine  models, product  numbers and
        part numbers.


        Product level assemblies are now identified by product  numbers instead
        of part numbers  (5700XX-XXX).  Product numbers contain  alphabetic and
        numeric characters making them inherently more descriptive than numeric
        only part  numbers.  You will  find the product  numbers easier  to use
        than part numbers.


        The product numbers are administered by marketing, at a level above the
        Engineering part number level.  This new plan accomodates the inclusion
        of MAC III and future enhancements in Engine products.


        The product numbers listed are  valid in the Order Entry  System (OES),
        Manufacturing's system, the  Planet program, the Equipment  Summary and
        associated price lists.  All  Engine product orders should use  the new
        product numbers,  not the  old part numbers.   The following  files are
        available in the PNETS directory on system 38 :

        If you are encountering  problems dumping nodes, but not  loading them,
        this could be the result of an obsolete version of the boot prom in the
        target node.


        Version 1 of the boot had a known problem which occasionally manifested
        itself by  allowing you  to load  but not  dump the  node.  If  you are
        seeing this  problem, have an  FE check your  version of boot  prom and
        upgrade it to version 6 if it is down level.
