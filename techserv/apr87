        PRODUCT:  TII Nodecode

        VERSION:  5.10

        CHANGES:  Reference (BASELINE)TII05.X10.  A new patch file is now
                  available; checksum is PEQTUP.  Highlights are:

                  .Correction to multi-line link reset patch.  An error was
                   introduced about October 6, 1986, which could cause reset
                   (initialization) problems.

                  .Extensive change to HDLC micro SIO line intialization patch.
                   Previously, SIO failures put nodecode in a loop waiting for
                   completion; eventually the node dropped out of the network.
                   Condition is now detected within 20 ms.; crypto msg. 72 is
                   reported (Note:  New use for existing message.); every 2 
                   secs. thereafter, initialization is retried.  The crypto 
                   message occurs for the first failure only.

        ACTION:  Re-gen your nodes if the following applies:

                 .The node has multi-line links.
              -or-
                 .The node is an HDLC micro, running Isis 7.03 and nodecode
                  5.10.  Parameter MACHIN EQ 2 must be in Tym file.

        Original Question by: Yomi Olatunde, Field Communications Consultant
                 Written by : Ted Yeh, HQ Network Staff Consultant

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        CUSTOMER  REPORTS THAT  ON SATELITE  LINKS, WHEN  A LINK  GOES  OUT AND
        REPORTS "DOWN", HE CANNOT GAIN  ACCESS TO THAT LINK WHEN IT  COMES BACK
        UP.  THAT IS, AFTER THE  LINK HAS BEEN RESTORED PHYSICALLY,  TMCS STILL
        REPORTS THE LINK  AS "DOWN" ON BOTH  NODES.  ONLY AFTER  RELOADING BOTH
        NODES, WILL THE LINKS COME BACK UP.


        IS THIS NORMAL?






        RESPONSE:


        From your  given problem description,  the situation could  happen; but
        rarely.  TMCS  gets information  from SUP  via NEM.   If TMCS  does not
        update the information,  it means SUP has  not updated the  link status
        yet. I did some test in my Lab. . .the status was always  updated while
        the link was disconnected and connected.


        If you know the node is up, and the status does not show this, then you
        may  issue RETAKE  <node#> command  in  PROBE to  force the  SUP  to go
        through the takeover process on  that node.  The status is  updated and


                                           4

        reloading the node is not necessary.  If you have more question on this
        please let me know.

                       4 -  Target Profile; X.25 Username Change







        Written by : Dan Lane, External Network Services
              Date : March 09, 1987






                     ** ATTENTION ALL X.25 HOSTS USING TARGET PROFILES **

        If you  have an X.25  host that is  originating calls using  the Target
        Profile option, that  is if    PKTOPT(+TRGPF)      is set in  your slot
        tym file, PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING CHANGE.


        An XCOM code anomoly was found in the target profile logic.  Currently,
        if an X.25 host originates an international call and  "target profiles"
        is  enabled, the  XCOM interface  sends the  username 'X25#####:GDNIC;'
        (where ##### is the X.25 host number) to the supervisor.


        In  approximately  30 days,  a  patch from  NTD  will be  added  to the
        betatest  (BETATEST)XCOM03.P01 patch  file to  correct an  anomoly, but
        causes  the  XCOM  interface  to  generate  a  different  username  for
        international calls using  target profiles.  After the  correction, the
        interface  will send  the username    'X25#####.[ODNIC]:GDNIC'   to the
        supervisor.  This  patch will  also be included  in XCOM  version 4.02.
        THIS IS ONLY FOR X.25 HOSTS MAKING OUTBOUND INTERNATIONAL  CALLS, WHERE
        PKTOPT(TRGPF)  IS SET.


        If  this  applies  to  your customer,  you  should  have  an additional
        username  X25#####.3106 validated  exactly like your  current X25.#####
        username.   For example,  if  your host  is using  target  profiles and
        'X2507812'   is  valid,  you should  request  through  validations that
        'X2507812.3106'  be set up in exactly the same format.


        For information on  target profiles, see:  TPUSER.DOC,  TPTECH.DOC, and
        TPTECH.DOC  on  TECHREF:56.   If you  have any  questions,  please call
        External Network Tech Support at   703/356-6995.

        Now that I finally, sort of  understand this, I am passing it  along to
        those of you using version 6.02 of the Consat (BETATEST ONLY!!)

        1.  If your slot is configured as a straight consat -

                  include SETFLAG(NOIIX,ON) in your slot .tym file.

        2.  If your slot is a consat with outdial capability - 
         
                NOIIX should default on, but include SETFLAG(NOIIX,ON) in
                your slot .tym file to be safe.

        3.  If your slot is a PAD -

                If you enter login mode and type ahead, after the password,
                you will encounter problems with IIX dialect negotiation.
                The only solution at this point is to not type ahead.  The
                consat group at NTD is working on this.

                If you function purely as a PAD you should have no problems.

        Things to remember:

            - Outdial and PAD capabilities are mutually exclusive.

            - With the PAD, NOIIX will be OFF.

        Original Question by : Vicki Warker, Field Communications Consultant
                 Response by : John Mckiernan, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                        Date : March 09, 1987







        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        IS IT POSSIBLE TO GEN IN MORE THAN ONE CANNED LOGIN IN THE SDLC TIF AND
        SELECT THE STRING WHEN THE TERMINAL IS POWERED ON OR IS IT POSSIBLE FOR
        THE TIF TO PROMPT WITH PLEASE LOG IN? I HAVE A CUSTOMER WHO  WOULD LIKE
        TO INSTALL  A SECOND HOST  INTERFACE ON  A SECOND HOST  AND BE  ABLE TO
        ACCESS IT USING THE SAME TERMINAL INTERFACES.


        OR IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT  VTAM MAY BE ABLE TO DO THIS  ROUTING IN
        THE FRONT END USING ONLY ONE TERMINAL INTERFACE?






        RESPONSE:


        Currently,  Tymnet's  SDLC interface  software  does not  allow  a 'per
        terminal' circuit.  The interface has been designed to provide a single
        circuit per control unit.  Thus there is no way to provide the 'Network
        services' screen of the the 3270 TI software (PBT or CMT) .


        SDLC does  have the limited  ability to use  the Operations  Monitor to
        modify  the destination  resources for  each SDLC  control  unit.  Such
        operations will generally create some problems in change control and/or
        security, however.  As such, it is not often recommended.

                                           9
        Alternate SDLC Destinations                              March 27, 1987


        Version  2.02  SDLC  allows  SVC  type  circuits  which  could  provide
        alternate destinations.  Username targeting is still the   basic limit,
        however.   Again,  the limit  of  one circuit  per  control  unit still
        exists.

        PRODUCT:  ISIS

        VERSION:  5.08, 7.00, 7.03

        CHANGES:  Previously, you had been advised of a problem with the
                  register refresh patch and high-speed async, such that
                  the register refresh patch was "removed".  Mid-November,
                  1986, the refresh patch was corrected for the async problem
                  and added to the patch file.  The tech notice is belatedly
                  sent to advise you of the corrected patch.

        ACTION:  Re-gen your Isis kernels that do not have the patch, i.e. 
                 those genned before November 18, 1986.  NOTE:  This date 
            applies to system 25.  Other systems may be a few days later, 
                 depending on delays in file propagation.  A safe date might be
                 November 21, 1986.

                2.  PRIOR APPROVAL HAS BEEN GIVEN BY THE MANAGER OF PROJECT 
                    IMPLEMENTATION TO BACKUP PUBLIC NETWORK NODE CODE.


            B.  THERE IS AN EXEC PROGRAM AVAILABLE VIA ONTYME TO SUBMIT A 
                BACKUP REQUEST.  TO ACCESS THE PROGRAM, TYPE THE FOLLOWING 
                COMMAND:

                EXEC *** FORMS.BACKUP

                THIS FILE HAS BEEN VALIDATED ON ALL INTERNAL HOSTS.  PLEASE 
                COMPLETE FULLY AND ACCURATELY.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE CKSUMS
                ARE INCLUDED AS REQUESTED PER THE FORMAT.  ALL BACKUP REQUESTS 
                ARE THEN SENT TO THE ONTYME ID, TYMOPS.BACKUP.

            C.  SLOT CODE WILL ONLY BE BACKED UP FROM THE FOLLOWING REGIONAL 
                DIRECTORIES:

                INTLTECH -   EXTERNAL NETWORK SERVICES

                SYSTEM 54 (PRIMARY) AND 33 (SECONDARY).  SLOT CODE WILL ONLY BE
                BACKED UP FROM THE DESIGNATED PRIMARY SYSTEM (25 OR 54).  BACK-
                UPS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED FROM THE SECONDARY SYSTEM (70 OR 33)
                IF THE PRIMARY SYSTEMS ARE DOWN.

            E.  ALL BACKUP REQUESTS WILL BE COMPLETED BY 12 NOON THE MORNING 
                THE ONTYME IS PULLED.  THE SAME AFTERNOON, A BACKUP REJECTION 
                REPORT IS SENT OUT TO ONLY THOSE WHOSE BACKUP(S) WERE REJECTED
                AND THE REASON WHY.  THERE MAY BE SOME DELAYS DUE TO CIRCUM-
                STANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL, i.e., host out of ports, system 
                down, THUS INHIBITING OUR TIME FACTORS.

            F.  A BATCH REQUEST IS SENT THE SAME EVENING TO TAPE ALL FILES 
                WORKED ON THAT SAME DAY TO THE SECONDARY SYSTEMS VIA FEDERAL
                EXPRESS.  AS A RESULT, ALL BACKUP REQUESTS SHOULD BE ON THE 
                SECONDARY CODE SYSTEMS WITHIN (48) HOURS OF SUBMISSION.


        II.  BACKUP REQUEST PROCEDURES - INTERNAL
             ------ ------- ----------

             A.  ONTYMES FOR THE USERNAME TYMOPS.BACKUP ARE PULLED ROUTINELY,
                 FIRST THING EVERY MORNING.  THE BACKUP REQUESTS RECEIVED ARE 
                 THEN DISTRIBUTED AMONGST THE INSTALLATION COORDINATORS IN

             B.  THE CKSUMS ON THE BACKUP REQUEST ARE COMPARED TO THE CURRENT
                 CKSUMS IN THE DESIGNATED REGIONAL DIRECTORY.  REQUESTS MAY BE 
                 REJECTED AT THIS POINT FOR ONE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS:

                 1.  THE CKSUMS ON THE BACKUP REQUEST DO NOT MATCH THE CURRENT
                     CKSUMS IN THE DESIGNATED REGIONAL DIRECTORY.

                 2.  NO FILES WERE FOUND IN THE DESIGNATED DIRECTORY/SYSTEM.

                 3.  THE SLOT REQUESTED TO BE BACKED UP EXCEEDS THE SLOT CORE 
                     ALLOCATION THE TYMFILE AND THERE IS NO ROOM FOR EXPANSION.

             C.  A DIRECTORY OF THE NODE TO BE BACKED UP IS DONE FOR (2) 
                 CHECKS:

                 1.  THERE MAY BE A TEMPORARY FILE AVAILABLE.  THIS WOULD 
                     SIGNAL A PENDING PROJECT REQUIRING SPECIAL TREATMENT.
         
                 2.  WHICH FILES NEED TO BE DELETED  TO ACCOMODATE THE NEW 
                     INCOMING FILES.

             D.  THE SLOT CODE IS THEN RENAMED FROM THE DESIGNATED REGIONAL 
                 DIRECTORY TO THE TYMNET OR TYM5 DIRECTORY.

             E.  A NEW BND FILE IS CREATED USING THE MERLIN PROGRAM.  THIS NEW 
                 BND FILE INCLUDES ALL OF THE MOST CURRENT SLOT CODE IN THE 
                 TYMNET OR TYM5 DIRECTORY.

             F.  THE NEW FILE IS THEN DECLARED "ALL READ READ".  THE CODE CAN
                 NOW BE ACCESSED BY ALL USERS.


        III.CODE ISSUES - SHORT TERM
            ---- ------   ----- ----

            A.  A CODE GENERATOR IS AVAILABLE ON A (24) HOUR BASIS SIMPLY BY
                CONTACTING NETWORK CONTROL.  NETWORK CONTROL WILL THEN 'BEEP' 
                THE CODE GENERATOR ON-CALL.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CODE 
                GENERATOR IS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC NETWORK NODE CODE.

            B.  SHORT TERM CODE ISSUES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED VIA ONTYME TO THE 
                MANAGER OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION.  AS A RESULT, THE CODE WILL 
                BE CORRECTED WITHIN (24) HOURS AND LOADED THE FOLLOWING 
                EVENING.  EITHER A VERBAL PHONE CALL OR WRITTEN RESPONSE WILL 
                BE SENT BACK TO THE CONCERNED INDIVIDUAL WITHIN (48) HOURS, 
                CONFIRMING THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED THEIR REQUEST.

            C.  IN URGENT SITUATIONS (CUSTOMER OUT OF NET), A PHONE CALL WILL 
                SUFFICE, FOLLOWED BY AN ONTYME.  THE CODE IS CORRECTED 
                IMMEDIATELY AND LOADED WHEN POSSIBLE, DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR 
                NOT ANY OTHER CUSTOMERS WILL BE AFFECTED.

        Are you frustrated because you've got a customer who needs cerification
        of an Async-to-3270 terminal or PC product, and  your request  has been
        in for months  now?  Don't fret, we've  got an answer to  your problem.
        THE  FIELD CERTIFICATION  PROGRAM.   Due to  the popularity  of  the QA
        certification  program,  field certification  should  be  considered if
        products are to be certified in a timely manner.  The QA group  will be
        concentrating   on  the   more  complex   products  that   require  new
        definitions.


        WHAT  MAKES  A  GOOD  CANDIDATE FOR  THIS  PROGRAM?   Terminals  and PC
        software that  run on existing  terminal definitions.  For  example, an
        IBM package  that emulates a  VT100.  The field  can help speed  up the
        certification process  on products  that can  run on  existing terminal
        macros.


        Linda Kypke and Mary Arnett have done extensive work to  make available
        to  the field  a  certification manual  which outlines  in  detail each
        certification process.  This manual can  be found on System 56,  and is
        called  (Techref)Cert.Prc.  If  you have  any questions  regarding this
        document, please feel free to give Mary Arnett or myself a call.


        To  sign up  for  field certification,  please  use the  exec  file ***
        Forms.verif.   The requesting  individual will  be notified  that their
        field certification  has been  accepted by  Marketing Support.   If you
        need any assistance  while completing the field  certification request,
        Dirk Heartman will be available to answer your questions.


        Thank you for your support of the field certification program.

        Datapac PAD Upgrade                                      March 27, 1987






                               14 -  Datapac PAD Upgrade

                      ATTENTION X.25 HOSTS WITH SUBSCRIBERS USING DATAPAC


        By the  end of  April, 1987, Datapac  will have  upgraded all  of their
        Asynchronous (3101) PADs  to comply with the  1984 level of  CCITT X.3,
        X.28, and X.29. Currently they comply with the 1976/1980 level of these
        standards.


        What does this mean?


        Datapac's PADs  will support PAD  Parameters 1 -  22.  This  means that
        users will now have the ability  to set and read the complete  range of
        X.3 PAD parameters.  Also, current Datapac National PAD parameters will
        also have CCITT Values, as below:


        Datapac National Par 118  is now also PAD Parameter 16 Datapac National
        Par 119  is now also PAD Parameter 17 Datapac National Par 120   is now
        also  PAD  Parameter 18  Datapac  National  Par 123   is  now  also PAD
        Parameter 21 Datapac National Par 126  is now also PAD Parameter 13


        The  most noticable  change  to your  customers  could be  in  the X.29
        responses  that X.25  hosts will  receive from  Datapac.  If  your host
        attempts  to do  X.29  READ and/or  SET  PAD commands  to  Datapac, the
        response could be different  after Datapac's change.  That  is, Datapac
        will be adding the following 5 parameters:


        Parameter 14, values 0 - 255  Parameter 15, values 0 - 1  Parameter 19,


                                          20
        Datapac PAD Upgrade                                      March 27, 1987


        values 0 - 1, 2, 8, 32 - 126 Parameter 20, values 0 - 255 Parameter 22,
        values 0 - 255


        So, for  example, if  your X.25 host  issues an  X.29 Read  All command
        after its users log in from Datapac, it will now receive an X.29 packet
        with values for parameters 1 - 22, instead of 1 - 13.


        For more  information on X.3,  X.28 or X.29,  please consult  the CCITT
        1984 recommendations.

                       16 -  Timers and Retry Sequences in SDLC







        Original Question by : Jacques Niveau, TNSC
                 Response by : John McKiernan, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                        Date : March 17, 1987







        Each  line  can have  its  own timer.   That  is the  basic  reason for
        defining each timer  at the LINE level  (or higher) or via  the LOPTION
        macro.  Each  station attached  to that  line will  use the  same timer
        value.


        Since events at each station are (basically) independent of each other,
        the interface  maintains separate timers  for each station.   As events
        require,  the associated  timer is  started and  will expire  after the
        designated time  has passed.   Most interfaces  implement this  type of
        timer based on the FASTC value when the timer is started.


        Similarly,  retries counters  are defined  at the  LINE level,  but the
        interface will maintain a separate counter for each station attached to
        that line.


        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


        To summarize  the HI  timer and retry  interactions during  NDM (Normal
        Disconnect  Mode) the  following  can (essentially)  be  extracted from
        available  SDLC documentation.   Please  review that  and  consult with
        others  in  your  organization.   NTD  has  reviewed  this  summary for
        accuracy.  If you still have any questions, let me know.


        I start with the assumptions you have provided, IE

          NCP 'REPLYTO' option is  7.0 seconds

          HI  'TNR.'    option is  6.0 seconds
          HI  'TRP.'    option is 21.0 seconds
          HI  'RETRIES' option is  (4,0,0)

          HI  has 03 stations defined on the line
          TI  has 03 stations inactive (CU's down)


        To establish NRM (Normal Response Mode) the following will take place -

        01: At time (00 seconds) the NCP sends 'SNRM' to station 01 .

        02: The NCP cannot send any frame for any other station until
            the response is returned or the NCP REPLYTO timer expires.

        03: The HI will start timer TRP. for station 01 .

        04: The HI will start timer TNR. for station 01 .

        05: The HI will pass 'SNRM' to the TI .

        06: The HI will decrement the RETRIES count for station 01 .

        07: While TNR. is still active, HI will search the XMT queue
            for the expected response.  If no response is received,
            the station (line) will return to receive mode.

        08: At time (07 seconds) the NCP sends 'SNRM' to station 02 .

        09: The NCP cannot send any frame for any other station until
            the response is returned or the NCP REPLYTO timer expires.

        10: The HI will start timer TRP. for station 02 .

        11: The HI will start timer TNR. for station 02 .

        12: The HI will pass 'SNRM' to the TI .

        13: The HI will decrement the RETRIES count for station 02 .

        14: While TNR. is still active, HI will search the XMT queue
            for the expected response.  If no response is received,
            the station (line) will return to receive mode.

        15: At time (14 seconds) the NCP sends 'SNRM' to station 03 .

        16: The NCP cannot send any frame for any other station until
            the response is returned or the NCP REPLYTO timer expires.

        17: The HI will start timer TRP. for station 03 .

        18: The HI will start timer TNR. for station 03 .

        19: The HI will pass 'SNRM' to the TI .

        20: The HI will decrement the RETRIES count for station 03 .

        21: While TNR. is still active, HI will search the XMT queue
            for the expected response.  If no response is received,
            the station (line) will return to receive mode.


        Let's assume just for an example that the TI CU's are  now operational.
        This  does not  really change  the sequence  of events  much  until the
        RETRIES counter for each station is decremented to zero and we start to
        pass a 'SNRM' again.


        22: At time (21 seconds) the NCP sends 'SNRM' for station 01 .

        23: As before, the NCP cannot send to other stations.

        24: The HI will NOT start timer TRP. for station 01 .

        25: The HI will NOT start timer TNR. for station 01 .

        26: The HI will NOT pass 'SNRM' to the TI .

        27: The HI will decrement the RETRIES count for station 01 .

        28: As before, the HI searches the XMT queue.


        The above sequence would be repeated for each station while the RETRIES
        count for the station is not zero.  At that point, the sequence changes
        to as follows -

        29: The HI will reset the RETRIES count for station 01 to 04 .

        30: At time (105 seconds) the NCP sends 'SNRM' for station 01 .

        31: As before, the NCP cannot send to other stations.

        32: The HI will start timer TRP. for station 01 .

        33: The HI will start timer TNR. for station 01 .

        34: The HI will pass 'SNRM' to the TI .

        35: The HI will decrement the RETRIES count for station 01 .

        36: As before, the HI searches the XMT while TNR. is active.

        37: If the TI returns a response while TNR. is active, the HI
            will transmit it to the NCP.  If the TI returns a response
            after TNR. expires, but before TRP. expires, the response

                                          25
        Timers and Retry Sequences in SDLC                       March 27, 1987


            will be sent after the next 'SNRM' for that station.  If
            the TI returns a response after BOTH timers expire, the
            response will be discarded.

        38: A sequence of events such as (29 - 37) will be repeated
            for other stations.  Eventually, all 03 stations should
            establish NRM .


        * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


        From the above, you can see that  if the NCP REPLYTO timer is set  to a
        smaller  value (such  as 03)  , the  HI TRP.  timer could  be set  to a
        smaller value such as 09 .  This may improve the delays associated with
        link and/or station initialization.  Such changes  provided significant
        improvements  for  another  customer  using  SDLC  multidrop  with some
        stations 'down' .


        You can also see that if the HI TRP. timer is defined via

          [# stations defined on the line * NCP REPLYTO value]


        The response should always be available when the next 'SNRM' command is
        received from the NCP (assuming the CU responds) .

        The purpose of TECHNICAL SERVICE'S Escalation Procedures is  to provide
        the field organization  with 24-hour per  day/7-day per week  access to
        software support resources at headquarters.


        Normal business-hour communications with Technical Servies will  be via
        OnTyme  and  telephone,  with  off-hours  and  'emergency'  access made
        through Network Control (see OFF-HOURS Support procedures, section 24)


        This procedure outlines how to escalate a problem to  the headquarter's
        technical suport  group.  It  describes the format  and content  of the
        formal escalation,  and the method  used to report  status on  all open
        escalations.   This  procedure  also  defines  how  de-escalations will
        occur.

                    19 -  ESCALATION TO HEADQUARTERS SUPPORT GROUPS


        All  software  problems  that have  existed  within  the  field support
        organization  for  48  hours,  and  have  not  been  resolved,  MUST be
        escalated to Technical Services.


        A network problem  is to be escalated  to Technical Services  by Tymnet
        field personnel (this  includes a field communication  consultant (CC),
        RTC, or project manager).


        An  OnTyme  "EXEC" program  has  been  created to  prompt  you  for the
        required information.  This Exec can be invoked by entering:

                              ":EXEC *** FORMS.RFI/ESCAL"


        A generic username has been set-up for anyone who does not  have access
        to  our Exec  file  through their  OnTyme  host.  Simply  login  to the
        following ID:

                                  KEY?  FIELD.ESC

        A  problem is  considered 'ESCALATED',  only after  this form  has been
        FULLY filled  out, completely  describing the nature  and scope  of the
        problem  and  sent  via  OnTyme  to  the  appropriate  persons  in  the
        headquarter's  technical  support  group.   [Incomplete  forms  will be
        rejected.]


        The distribution list, that an escalation will be directed  to, depends
        upon the software type involved.   The files listed below will  be used
        for  escalation  to  the  individual  responsible  for  supporting that
        product, as well  as the appropriate  unit manager.  In  addition, your
        ontyme will  be copied to  the appropriate Network  Technology Division
        (NTD)  personnel,  responsible  for development,  and  to  the National
        Technical Support (NTS) personnel, responsible for hardware.  This will

        The OnTyme sender sould always  use the ":SEND CC" option, so  that all
        receipients can verify that the appropriate people were copied.  If the
        originator would like  to include other  individuals in the  routing of
        the  OnTyme,  they are  free  to do  so.   It is  recommended  that the
        originator, as well as  their manager, account representative,  and the
        sales representative for the account, be copied on the escalation also.


        If a problem reaches Technical Services, which requires  the assistance
        of NTS, then Technical Services will immediately forward the escalation
        to the appropriate NTS personnel.

                        20 -  ASSIGNING ESCALATIONS A PRIORITY


        The  priority  of  escalations,  within  Technical  Services,  will  be
        established on a first-in/first-out  basis for each of  the established
        priority levels.   All escalations  must be  assigned a  priority.  The
        priority  will indicate  the severity  of the  problem  being reported.
        This  priority  number  is  to  be  assigned  by  the  Field  CC,  with
        concurrence of the customer.  This process establishes responsibilities
        for  both  parties and  commits  the customer  to  certain  actions and
        responsibilities.   This  allows  us  to  focus  on  the  most critical
        problems  and manage  the  escalation and  its resolution  in  the most
        efficient manner.

                      21 -  TECHNICAL SERVICES ESCALATION TO NTD


        With  regard to  problems  escalated to  Technical  Services, Technical
        Services will  become the focal  point for all  communication regarding
        the  problem  escalation.   Technical  Services  will  also  assume the
        function of problem management.   Technical Services may draw  upon the
        resources of  (NTD), as  well as  other technical  groups, to  effect a
        final solution to a problem escalation.


        Problems  submitted to  Technical Services  for resolution  may  not be
        solvable  by the  assigned  support person.   This  may be  due  to the
        complexity of  the problem,  or to time  constraints.  In  these cases,
        Technical  Services  will draw  upon  the resources  of  NTD  for final
        resolution.  In all cases,  software problems that have  existed within
        Technical Services  for more than  72 hours WILL  BE escalated  to NTD.
        Depending on priorities, escalations may be forwarded to NTD as soon as
        12 hours.  The  means of escalation will  be an OnTyme message  sent by
        Technical Services to the triple-star product file, which  includes the
        developer,  the  developer's  manager,  the  Technical  Service's  Unit
        Manager,  and the  submittor of  the original  escalation.   The OnTyme
        message  will  contain  all  information  provided  with  the  original
        escalation,  as  well  as  any  information  gathered  while  technical
        services was working to resolve the problem.

                      22 -  TECHNICAL SERVICES ESCALATION TO NTS


        In the event a  software escalation submitted to Technical  Services is
        subsequently determined  to invovle a  hardware anomaly,  the following
        steps are taken:

        1.  The HQ Network Consultant must inform the initiator of the 
            escalation, via Ontyme, of the following:

            a.  Escalation number and customer name.
            b.  Findings relating to the escalation.
            c.  Instructions for the CC to contact the local FE to take 
                appropriate action.
            d.  Statement that the escalation is being forwarded to NTS for
                follow-up on the hardware problem.

            The HQ Network Consultant will copy the appropriate (***) distri-
            bution file, in addition to the field CC.

        2.  The HQ Technical Administrator, upon receipt of the above OnTyme, 
            will formally escalate to NTS.  For administrative purposes, the
            priority of the escalation will be reduced to a level '5' during
            the time the escalation is with NTS.  Information to be included 
            will be the following:

            a.  Original escalation number, customer name, and related informa-
                tion.
            b.  All subsequent findings of the field and HQ Tech Svc's staff.

            This escalation to NTS should be copied to the appropriate (***)
            file and the field CC, who originated the escalation.

        3.  An acknowledgement via Ontyme will be made by NTS within 24 hours
            to the field CC and the approprite (***) file.  This OnTyme will
            contai the following information:

            a.  escalation number and customer name.
            b.  The name of the NTS person assigned to resolve the escalation.
            c.  The action which will be taken towared resolution.

        4.  NTS will follow-up with OnTymes sent to field CC and appripriate
            (***) fiels as to the progress/findings/resolution.


        NOTE:   THIS  PROEDURE ONLY  APPLIES  WHEN A  "SOFTWARE"  ESCALATION IS
        SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINED, BY TECHNICAL SERVICES, TO INVOVLE A 'HARDWARE'

        TO FOLLOW NORMAL 'HARDWARE ESCALATION PROCEDURES'.

                           23 -  ESCALATION RESPONSIBILITIES


        A problem escalated to Technical services or NTD in no way releases the
        CC, originating the escalation,  from the responsibility to aid  in the
        problem  resolution.   The  CC must  maintain  daily  contact  with the
        customer, keepig the customer  informed of the progress of  the problem
        investigation.  Information or assistance to Technical  Services should
        be provided in a timely fashion.  Technical Services is responsible for
        keeping the CC informed of progress.  If it is necessary  for Technical
        Services to speak directly  to the customer, the responsible  CC should
        be included in that  conversation.  If this is not  possible, Technical
        Services  will report  via OnTyme  any customer  contact that  was made
        without the knowledge of the responsible CC.


        If  the problem  is escalated  to NTD,  the Technical  Services support
        person  still  maintains problem  management  responsiblity.  Technical
        Services continues to be  responsible for keeping all  parties informed
        on the progress of the problem resolution.






                            23.1  MANAGEMENT OF ESCALATIONS


        If, according to the escalation's initiator, a problem is not receiving
        the attention that  will result in a  resolution timely enough  for the
        customer, the assigned priority  may be changed by the  ATM responsible
        for  the  account,   assuming  the  criteria  listed   under  "Software
        Escalation Priorityes" is met.   This is not a subject  for negotiation
        between the CC  and the Technical  Services support person.   The sales
        group will not  have direct access to  the support person working  on a
        problem.  The sales staff should  check with the ATM for  status, since
        it is  ultimately the ATM's  responsibility to know  the status  of all
        problems escalated to Technical Services.  If Technical Services is not
        keeping  the field  informed  of progress,  that  is a  matter  for the
        manager of Technical Services and not the individual support persons.


        Technical Services can reduce the priority of a problem for one  of the
        following reasons:

        1) The responsible CC requests the priority level be reduced.

        2) The criteria outlined under "Software Escalation Priorities" is not

                           23.2  REPORTING AND DE-ESCALATING


        Technical Services will publish an "Escalation Summary"  report, daily,
        which summarizes the status on progress made toward de-escalation; see:
        (TECHSERV:56,70)ESCSUM.LST .   This summary also  outlines the  area of
        current  responsibility for  each escalation,  (Tech Support,  NTD, CC,
        NTS, etc.).   Field personnel  are responsible  for verifying  that all
        problems  that have  been escalated  to Technical  Services are  in the
        report.


        Technical Services can de-escalate  a problem for one of  the following
        reasons:


        1) Both the CC, who  escalated the problem, and the  customer reporting
        the  problem, agree  that  the problem  has  been resolved  or  that an
        alternative solution has been reached.


        2) The problem has not reoccured for seven (7) days.


        3)  A  fix  has  been  provided  and  there  is  no  response  from the
        responsible CC after a seven (7) day period.


        The CC is responsible for filling out the de-escalation form,  by using
        the Ontyme Exec file.  The  exec is initiated by entering  the command:
        ":EXEC *** FORMS.DEESCAL".   This form must be  sent via OnTyme  to all
        interested  parties,  using  the  (***)  distribution  file.   The  de-
        escalation notice will include  the location of the new  backed-up slot
        code.  If, in the case of numbers 2) and 3) above, the CC does  not de-
        escalate the problem, Technical Services  will do it for the  CC.  When
        Project Implementation  informs Technical Services  that the  backup is
        completed, the problem will be de-escalated.


        If the problem was caused by a bug in the software,  Technical Services
        must document the software problem  with an NSR before the  problem can
        be de-escalated.  If a problem is caused by the software not supporting
        a new feature, the problem may be de-escalated after submitting  an PIR
        to document the requested feature.  In these cases,  Technical Services
        will inform Tymnet Product  Marketing of the requested new  feature, so

        The following, describes the call procedures for software assistance on
        any  products supported  by  HQ Technical  Services,  on public/private
        networks.

        Calls to NSCC or NETCON will proceed as follows:

           A.  NSSC or NETCON will dial "289-6403" to IRT (Intrastate Radio 
               Technology of San Francisco).  Wait for 3 short tones, then 
               press the phone number that the callee should return the call 
               to, for messages (usually this will be Network Control's phone 
               number).  Wait for another 3 short tones, and hang up the
               handset.

               It will take approximate 4 minutes for the call to reach the 
               designated pager.  If originator of page receives no response 
               within 10 minutes, Netcon should try the process again.

           B.  If no response within a total of 30 minutes, originator should 
               call:
                        
                           1. Carl Langdon    
                           2. Shirley Chiang  
                           3. Doug Ellenberg  
                           4. Gary Walker
