-----------------------------------------

please investigate tkt 297276.

in qllc hif if GPU.PACTPU (this marco
is completely nothing to do with sdlc
protocol) is not defined, then the code
gen will fail. this certainly will cause
a lots of trouble for sdlc upgrades.

please let me know as soon as you have
a solution.

thx, ben
