XCOM Slot TYMFILE Inactivity Timer 

In order to help lessen the number of similar patches scattered throughout
various individual directories, here is a Slot Tymfile patch for version 3.01
Inactivity Timers.

These patches (one includes host to host, gateway connections, one does
not) are the same inactivity time patches you are familiar with now,
with one change.  The line

TOMINS          BC         14                : 20 MINUTES INACTIVITY

which was near the top of any inactivity time patch has been replaced with 

TOMINS          BC         INACTR            : SET VALUE IN SLOT TYMFILE
                                 
Add into your Slot Tymfile 

INACTR EQ 14                                 : 20 MINUTE INACTIVITY TIMER

And gen the patch into your Command file from (XCOMPAT) directory.  This
will eliminate the need to edit the patch, change the value and rewrite
it into your directory.

"INACTR" must start in Column 1 in your Slot Tymfile, like the CRSTOP
statement.  A sample Tymfile might start like this...

 :        COMMENT
 :        COMMENT

If the user presses the ESC and another key instead of the labeled PF
keys for the programmable function keys, the ESC key will take him back
to the main menu of Relay Gold package.  The package always takes the
user back to its main menu upon the first ESC key being pressed and
brings him back to the original upon the second ESC key being pressed.

I also found that the control-H key of the VT100 generates Hex code 1B
5B 44 (ESC [ D) instead of Hex code 08, which key does the function just
like left-arrow rol-H key for back-tab function on our existing VT100
profile.  Surprisingly, the control-J key of VT100 generates Hex code 0e
instead of 0A.

In addition, when the CMT sends Hex 08 for moving one space back on TTY
mode, the package not only does move one space back but also deletes the
character at the cursor position.

I recommend that two new terminal profiles will be created for VT100 and
TTY for the file transfer so that we will not stay with the limitation
of the existing profiles.

Revised Staging Policy - NETWORK SYSTEMS STAGING UNIT 
     
The Network Systems Staging Unit has recently moved under the direction
of Tymnet Operations.  Enhancements have been made to the staging
policy.  The revised staging policy follows.  You are encouraged to read
and understand this policy which defines our commitment to serving your
needs in satisfying customer requirements.

MISSION

We are committed to serving your needs and assuring our products conform
to customer requirements.  We will insure the quality and the
functionality of network system orders.  All request for exceptional
service will be given careful consideration.

POLICY STATEMENT

The  Network  Systems  Staging  Unit  (NSSU)  will  insure  that  the
responsibilities of this policy are accomplished.    
              
Staging is a mandatory requirement under specific conditions (See NODE
SALES ORDER MANDATORY STAGING).  NSSU will comply with staging
contractual requirements, and also, emulate the customer production
environment of equipment as schedules and resources allow.

Performance Certification  will  be  accomplished  after  the  system
integration of the hardware and target code, (See Appendix A).

When required, Customer Factory Acceptance Testing will be performed
upon completion of staging.

Field personnel are required to participate at the staging facility, for
complex orders (See Appendix B) and to assist in meeting delivery
schedules.  Field personnel may elect to participate in staging any
order.  Field personnel will temporarily report to the Manager of NSSU
for the duration of their participation at the staging facility.  For
the time parameters associated with staging please refer to Appendix C.

STAGING RESPONSIBILITIES

The following tasks are performed on orders staged:

          -  manage staging projects
          -  coordinate with other companies/departments
          -  accept hardware from manufacturing
          -  install equipment in its ordered configuration
          -  reconcile/modify the target code to conform to STAGENET
          -  integrate the hardware and target code
          -  certify network conformance

          -  certify slot performance 
          -  escalate discovered discrepancies for corrective action
          -  complete and distribute the staging certification and
             customer response form
          -  release hardware back to manufacturing for shipment
          -  record and feedback discrepancy information
          -  factory acceptance testing when contractually required

At the discretion of NSSU, tasks performed on orders staged are as follows:

          -  audit the Interim Order Entry System (IOES) order for
             administrative and technical completeness and accuracy
          -  provide hardware configuration to manufacturing
          -  reconcile the ordered hardware to the TYMFILE
          -  reconcile the FOS (factory traveler) to the IOES order
          -  reconcile the FOS to the equipment
          -  reconcile the hardware and software to Beta Test
             conformance
          -  reconcile the equipment to ECO conformance
          -  run diagnostics
          -  certify every I/O port
          -  certify battery backup
          -  certify the 220 volt power system
          -  perform corrective action
          -  perform special test
          -  perform special audits

NODE SALES ORDER MANDATORY STAGING

The equipment must be staged when a node sales order satisfies one or
more of the following criteria:

          -  all Private Network and Virtual Sub-network node  orders,
             except  those processed through Computer Systems Company,
             United Kingdom (CSCUK).
          -  contractual obligation
          -  all nodes destined outside the contiguous 48 states,
          -  all nodes with peripherals
          -  Beta Test products for as long as Product Marketing
             determines

STAGING WAIVER

There may be exceptional situations, in which mandatory factory staging
may be waived by plan.  The procedure that will allow variance to the
staging policy, is as follows:

1.  The District Sales Manager  must  request  the  staging  waiver
    from  the Director, Field Operations via Ontyme, with a copy of
    the request sent to the other Field  Sales personnel  involved.

2.  The Ontyme  must  present  the  business  case  justifying  the
    staging waiver and also identify the following:

    a.  customer name
    b.  contractual staging obligations
    c.  Beta Test hardware or software (Y/N)

    d.  hardware type, e.g. DMINI, MICRO4, etc.
    e.  primary Tymnet software,  e.g. Consat, Switcher, SUP, TMCS, etc.
    f.  IOES Purchase Order Number(s)  

3.  The  Director, Field Operations will determine the merit of the request. 
    If approved, the request will be processed through the Marketing Vice
    President.

    a.  If  staging is to be waived, the Director, Field Operations will send  
        an Ontyme  message to the Manager of Order Processing notifying 
        Operations to waive staging on the orders identified by customer
        Purchase Order Number(s), and Requisition Number(s).
    b.  If staging  will  NOT  be  waived, this decision will be conveyed to 
        the  original  requester  and  CC  list  with explanation.

                                 APPENDIX  A

                   TARGET CODE AND HARDWARE CONFIGURATION

Target code is the Tymnet production software which provides the
customer's application upon installation at their site.  It is the
unique loadable code for each order (Engine or node).  The hardware
configuration provides detailed assembly location interrelationships,
option and address selection information.  The organization responsible
for generating the target code, or for initiating the order, is required
to perform the following:

1.  Certify  that  the  hardware  configuration reconciles to the IOES
    Manufacturing Requisition and to the TYMFILE (software).

2.  Provide the hardware configuration to Manufacturing and NSSU, twenty
    one ( 21 ) days prior to the manufacturing commit date via IOES.

3.  Notify NSSU of the location of the target code (BND, CMD, and TYM) files,
    seven (7)  days prior to the manufacturing commit date via IOES

4.  Provide "Staging Test Code" in lieu of target  code  when the customer's
    situation prevents target code  generation.   This must be identified as 
    staging test code and be a best approximation of the customers
    application for this order.

                               APPENDIX B

               COMPLEX ORDER MANDATORY FIELD PARTICIPATION

The organization responsible for generating, or supporting the target
code may be required to participate at the staging facility.
Individuals who participate in the staging function are often called
upon for technical leadership.  Mandatory field participation is
required at the staging facility, if an order satisfies one or more of
the following criteria:

          -  a network utility, e.g. SUP, NETVAL, TMCS, ONTYME, etc.
          -  the initial phase of a new network system
          -  a new major product in Beta Test

                                  APPENDIX C

                           STAGING AVERAGE DURATIONS

Discretionary audits or testing will extend these durations.  Staging
will not be expedited.  With weekends and holidays excluded, the usual
workdays required for software staging are defined in the list below.
          
                PRODUCT                                    DAYS

Little Known Network Statistics

Here is a little known network statistic that you can add to your next
Tymnet sales pitch:

     -  52 Public Data Network providers are currently utilizing Tymnet
        Packet Switching Equipment to deliver their service.
     -  43 of these are under a Managed Data Network Contract (Sub-net)
        The other 9 have their own NCC (Supervisor).
     -  This means that 43 Public Data Network providers trust Tymnet as
        their partner in communications to provide reliable and cost effective
        network management, accounting, validations, routing control,
        software engineering and code management.
     -  This is more Public Data Network providers than any other equipment
        manufacturer.  We have been doing this since 1977, longer than anyone
        else.

SUBJECT:

Interpretation of CMT Screen Buffer Addresses

QUESTION:

In the receive buffers of the associated SNA 3.03 interface, one can see
an LU-LU message with a particular 3270 order. It is 111D40 : SBA . The 
host is a Facom computer (Fujitsu) speaking English. However, this order
is passed on to the CMTK ring and CMTK clears this circuit with message
CMT032 : invalid screen address. As a matter of fact, this is rather
understandable for 1D does not seem to be a valid screen address. The
problem is that the Facom terminal does understand it. We don't. The
customer has been requested to provide detailed and adequate information 
on this particular order. The thing is, we don't know how long this will take.
Has anyone out there ever heard anything on this ? How should we interpret
this order ? Should we ignore it ? Is the Facom faulty ? Should the latter
be answered with yes, I'm not sure the customer would agree to modify his
host. Anyhow, any input is most welcome.

The use of CMTK has been recommended and approved last November by NTD's
Mike Rude. This customer (the first one in Spain) must manage a Fujitsu
host through FNA.

In this case when the LU to LU addressing took place the host issued the
Set Buffer Address (SBA) order 111D40, 11 is the SBA and 1D40 the actual
address.  To determine what type of addressing will be used, the 14-bit
binary or 12-bit coded CMTK looks at the first 2 bits of the byte
following the SBA.  The 1D40 is interpreted as 0001 1101 0100 0000, the
first two bits being the addressing type determiner are set to zero the
CMTK selects 14 bit binary mode addressing.
     
                           ADDRESSING TABLE 
     
                 00             14-bit binary address follows    
                 01             12-bit coded address follows
                 10             Reserved
                 11             12-bit coded address follows
     
To determine the actual screen position in the 14-bit mode, the next 14
bits are represented in binary form and no actual translation is
necessary.  In this case where the 1D40 was sent the CMTK took the
binary form and translated it as follows:
     
         0001  1101  0100  0000        > 780 hex  
         1      D      4    0          > 780 hex  
     
A value greater than 780 hex is a non-existent screen buffer address and
CMTK issued the invalid screen address message.

The Fujitsu host may be assuming that CMTK will always use the 12-bit
coded addressing mode and code the address as follows:
     
        0001  1101  0100  0000        : > 780 hex 
        XX          XX                : Throw away these bits    
        0111  0100  0000              : compress to form address 
          7         4       0         : < 780 hex 
     
Because 740 is less than 780 hex it is a valid screen buffer address and
the hosts screen will respond without error if not going through the
CMTK interface.  If the customers host wants to continue to use the
12-bit coded method of addressing screen buffers, the two high order
bits following the SBA must be set to 01 or 11.  I am making no
recommendations on what your customer should do, I am just explaining
what may have happened.

Large amounts of probe messages from PBT

There has been a high incidence of probe messages that Southwestern Bell
was seeing from their PBT.

The message type 13 (facilities failure detected) is the result of
supervisor messages issued by the PBT when a control unit stops
responding to polls.  When that occurs a supervisor message will be
issued for each device on that control unit.

The message type 30(circuit zap) is generated when the PBT subsequently
zaps the circuits for the devices on the control unit that went inactive.

I first went into the BOM of the PBT and used the DERR command to see an
hourly summarized error report for the last 24 hours that the interface
was running.  One of those hour blocks showed a high incidence of errors
including poll timeouts, transmit errors and receive errors.  I believe
that this time period may have corresponded to the time period that the
probe messages were being generated.

I then reviewed both the probe log and the PBT's DERR record for the
past 24 hours again.  I did not observe either a high incidence of
errors or a high incidence of probe messages indicating interface
problems or circuit zaps.

My understanding is that the interface has been running for
approximately two weeks.  Since during that time the occurrence of this
event appears to be isolated, intermittent, and associated with
indicated problems in communicating with the control unit, I don't think
we are looking at a problem with the PBT.  Possibly this could be the
result of a line or modem problem, a control unit problem, or the
control unit just being turned off.

Should this event occur again there are a few things you or somebody
could do to get a better picture of the problem.  At the time the
problem is occurring, go into the BOM and display the status of the
control unit indicated in the probe messages; it will indicate some
error conditions that may be occurring.  Verify the actual status of the
control unit and line; powered on, good signals, etc..  Do a DERR
command for the last 24 hours and see if it matches up with time of the
probe reports.  If the findings appear unusual or can't be explained
then we have something to start pursuing.

Tracing Circuits Through TI and TII Gateways

The way to trace a circuit through a TII gateway from Tymnet into a
private network is to log into the gateway slot and do a ?CT.  The port
number which you got from the trace through the public network will be
mapped to a DPort in the gateway.  Then go into Probe in the private
network and do the race command using that new port number.  Please note
that port numbers in Probe are DECIMAL and the port numbers from the ?CT
command are in HEXADECIMAL.

To trace through a TI gateway is a little more complicated.  After doing
the ?CT command as above, do a ?STAT command followed by a port command.
This set of commands will accomplish the following:

    Node Code DPORT --> Gateway DPORT --> Gateway Channel Number

When you go into Probe on the private network, you once again do a trace
command.  This trace command is as follows:

      : Trace n2 n1 c1
 
where        n2 = Tymnet II node to which the gateway is attached
                 n1 = Gateway node number (private net side)
                 c1 = channel number

SUBJECT:

X.25 via Nodecode Performance

The question concerned delays when doing a file transfer between two X.25
slots.  It was observed that slot to slot within node was much quicker
than when the X.25 interfaces were in different machines.  The maximum
Tymnet packet size was 62 bytes.  Changing DI.BFL to four increased the
delay.
 
Answer:  Throughput is best described in terms of Nodal throughput and
Circuit throughput.

NODAL THROUGHPUT:  The DI.BFL assigns the number of bufferlets to put in
the bufferlet pool for each circuit.  The bufferlets are not actually
assigned to a dispatcher port, but are used as needed.  Thus, one dport
can require numerous bufferlets while other dports don't use any
bufferlets.  Thus, DI.BFL affects the possibility of buffer zaps, but
should not have a general effect upon throughput.  Increasing the size
of the Node Code dispatcher rings (legal values are:  400x (default),
800x, 1000x and 2000x) can prevent dispatcher buffering from occurring.
Dispatcher buffering is much less efficient than the dispatcher copying
ring to ring, thus preventing dispatcher buffering can have a serious
improvement upon maximum sustained throughput.  Not much else can be
done to improve performance although preliminary testing of Node Code
V5.31 has shown a significant performance improvement since V5.31
removed inefficiencies in earlier versions of Node Code.

CIRCUIT THROUGHPUT is limited by line capacity and gouging level.
Obviously a 9.6 line limits a circuit to 1200 cps.  Gouging level is
used by node code to give high and low speed circuits fair usage of the
link's bandwidth.  Gouging is not used in intranode slot to slot
transfers.  Gouging limits a circuit to 64, 160, 512 and 2048 cps for
gouging class A, B, C and D respectively.

PACKET SIZE:  Node Code makes the biggest packet it can.  The packet
size is limited by the amount of data and by gouging level.  Data may be
waiting in the buffer but will not be sent since the cps maximum has
already been reached for that second.  All user traffic through Node
Code is treated as individual bytes.  Thus, a large X.25 packet received
in Node Code's dispatcher ring can be sent as several Tymnet packets.
Conversely, several small X.25 packets can be sent as one large Tymnet
packet.  Thus, if the maximum packet size was 60 or so bytes when doing
a file transfer then it appears that gouging level might have been the
limiting factor.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

One additional piece of information:  When data passes through Node Code,
all characters less than hex 08 are escaped with a hex 00.  If in the
file transfer there are a large number of characters less than hex 08 then
the actual characters transferred is two for every one of these.  This
extra overhead will effect the rate of transfer because of the additional
characters transmitted.

SUBJECT:

TMCS Message Meanings

The reasons for "data on an unassigned channel" may be  that there was a
zap sent on that channel, causing node code to think the circuit was
terminated (or now unassigned) and following the zap being sent out data
was received.  This would be because of timing (data in the circuit not
yet cleaned up by the zap).

Neighbor 0 may have been reported because this circuit was a dispatcher
circuit where there would be no node number, the permuter tables could
have been corrupted, or this may be an undetected node code bug
(probably the cause was this was a dispatcher circuit).

Circuit lifetimes are reported after certain error conditions occur.
This is to aid in tracking the causes of problems.  If the circuit
lifetime is long, you know the circuit has been up for awhile.  If the
circuit lifetime is very short you may have an indication of a timing or
race condition occurring which may be a potential cause of the associated
error message.

In this instance, the circuit lifetime message may be being sent in error
so the times reported may be of questionable value.  There is no
negative impact so this is nothing to worry about.

Original question:

2112 node report, data on unassigned channel 1E
       neighbor 0  <8.2>
2112 node report, circuit lifetime 310 seconds on channel 1e

Why is there "data on unassigned channel"?
Why is there a "non-existent" neighbor node "0" to node 2112?
What is the purpose of reporting circuit lifetimes?

EXCT Counts versus High Speed Interrupts

The question included a list of EXCT counts, CPS I/O and number of users
for a target node.  Question was for a recommendation if this node can
safely be set to high speed interrupts.

In response to your question concerning a loaded node being upgraded to
high speed interrupts:  Any ISIS node with an EXEC count commonly below
20 is operating at very close to maximum capacity.  High speed
interrupts add significant load and no ISIS machine with common EXEC
below 50 should be upgraded to high speed interrupts.

Please note that the EXEC low water in the XRAY NS must be used with
care.  The EXEC count which is most useful is gathered by doing the NS
command at some regular interval (like every 10 minutes during periods
of peak load) and noting the current EXEC count.  The low water EXEC
count can be quite low even in lightly loaded machines since unusual
events can cause a transitory heavy load which do not accurately reflect
upon the machines true load.  Go_u
