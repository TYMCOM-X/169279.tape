ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   Usually the right most (2) digits of a front panel indicate the number of
   circuits terminated on that node, plus the number of passthroughs currently
   through that node.  The micro, however, sometimes shows 'FE' or 'FC' alter-
   nately, but actually not that many circuits are within the node.  Does
   the node code use the last 2 digits for some other purpose?  Any special
   meaning by the 'FE' and/or 'FC' being displayed?



RESPONSE:

   The right-hand 2 digits of the micro, when the front panel is displaying 
   information for slot 0, displays the righthand 2 digits of the number of 
   active ports.  This number is computed by nodecode (slot 0).  It is 
   increased every time a needle or pseudo-needle is received, and decreased 
   by 1 when a zapper is received.

   HOWEVER IT IS NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE.

   Due to login race conditions, this number can become inaccurate - i.e. 
   become too big or too small.  In your case, it went negative - 'FE' = -2 
   and 'FC' = -4.

   When you do  a 'ND' in XRAY, this number will be accurately computed.    
   Next time you see this happen, go into XRAY and do an 'ND' and observe 
   the righthand 2 digits of the console change to a more reasonable number.

   I assume that you know, of course, that the front panel can display 
   information on other slots - by pressing DATA <slot#> RUN.  These other 
   slots can display whatever they want in the front panel - however, you will
   not see the distinctive slot 0 display , where you have a 3-second display,
   then a 1-second display alternating.

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   I have received a request that a backup disc be created for my cusotmer's
   TMCS node.  I need to know how to proceed with this process.  By loading
   the node via PDP-10 onto a formated disc pack, I am concerned about losing
   TMCS history buffers, as well as, user profiles.  How can we retain all the
   information that is located on the production disc pack?



RESPONSE:

   The following is the procedure to archive disk files to tape.  In this
   procedures, use the first value of the DTAPE parameter of the TMCS slot 
   tymfile as the value of tape unit #:

       o  Insert a write ring in a scratch tape
       o  Mount the scratch tape on an available TMCS unit
       o  Log into TMCS
       o  At the * prompt enter

                 ARCHIVE STORE {tape unit #}

       The name of each file will be displayed beofe it is stored; example:

       PROFILE STORED
       HOST NAME STORED
       HOST LOCATION STORED
       NODE NAME STORED
       PROBE STORED

        (etc)

       o  Remove the write ring from the tape and remount
       o  At the * prompt enter

                 ARCHIVE DIRECTORY {tape unit #}

   The files stored on the tape will display in the following format:

       TAPEPOS   MM/DD/YY   HH:MM:SS    FILENAME    SIZE

       o  Remove the tape from the drive and store it


   If TMCS seems to be working improperly due to a possible disk problem

       o  Take out the disk pack
       o  Insert a test pack
       o  Load disk diagnostics
       o  Restore the disk pack belonging to TMCS

   Adjust the hardware according to the diagnostics.  If there was nothing
   wrong with the controller, reformat the TMCS disk.

   To restore the stored data perform the following:

       o  Reload TMDM using the configuration existing at the time of the
          last archive store

       o  Initialize the disk

       o  Reload TMCS also using the same configuration at the time of the 
          last archive store

       o  Remount the archived tape

       o  Log into TMCS


       At the * prompt, execute:

                 ARCHIVE RESTORE {tape unit #}

       o  Halt and execute the TMCS slot

   The procedure is complete.

       RECOVERY AFTER TERMINAL GOES DOWN (MIDWAY THROUGH TRANSMISSION)

ORIGINAL QUESTIONS:

   Host sends data to HIF--HIF acknowledges it--sends it on to TIF, but then 
   the terminal goes down and doesn't get all the data.  What happens?



RESPONSE:

   If the terminal comes back up within 12 minutes, nothing at all.  The user
   can keep going with his application.  Any data that was queued up for the 
   terminal when it went down, will be sent to the terminal.

   After 12 minutes, the TIF will perform a cleanup operation, deleting any
   data bound for that terminal.  If the terminal comes up after the 12 
   minutes, any data queued for the terminal will be lost;  however, the user
   can type <something> TRANSMIT and the application should respond.

   Note that, just because a terminal goes down, its circuit is NOT zapped.  
   (Exception: if ALL the terminals on a line go down, i.e. stop responding to
   polls, when we finally give up trying to poll them we WILL zap all the 
   circuits on that line.)

      The default setting for inactivity is no hang.  The number of minutes
    of inactivity, to elapse before a user is to be dropped, must be specified
    with the 'inact' option.  This option may be set at the global, host, or
    subhost level.  In the case of an async outdial tymcom, this option would
    be set at the host level.  Project Implementation would not be responsible
    for this customer's portion of the code since addition of an inactivity
    timer would fall inter the non-standard configuration category.  A
    Communications Consultant would be responsible for submitting the revision
    to Project Implementation.  The procedure is as follows:

    Non-Standard Configurations
    ---------------------------

    Communications Consultants shall be responsible for configuration of 
    individual customer's portion of the Outdial slot Tymfile and for updating
    the "REVISION HISTORY".

    1.  The Communication Consultant may configure the individual customer's
        portion of the Outdial interface in any way he deems appropriate so
        long as it may be affected at the host, subhost, or port level.
   
    2.  The Communication Consultant may NOT alter the hardware, TOM, or
        global level configuration of the Outdial interface.

    3.  The Communication Consultant MUST provide Project Implementation with
        the appropriate individual customer host portion of the Outdial slot
        Tymfile 72 hours before the scheduled installation.  Project 
        Implementation shall be responsible for code generation and install-
        ation of the slot code.

    Complications in communicating with the called device after the slot has
    been succesfully loaded, shall be the responsibilty of the Communication
    Consultant (responsible to the customer account being installed) to
    resolve using the resources of a Communication Consultant local to the
    Outdial slot.  Under NO circumstances shall Project Implementation be
    contacted to troubleshoot the Outdial slot code after the slot has been 
    successfully loaded.  Project Implementation must be notified of any 
    subsequent changes made to the original Outdial slot code by Communication
    Consultants.

    ----------------------------

    NOTE : This memo refers to the async outdial offering, utilizing the async
           Tymcom code.  It does not refer to other outdial offerings.

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   How can the Inactivity Timer be overriden by the Application ID field,
   in the DSP logon string?



RESPONSE:

   The answer to you question is explained in the SNA ERS manual.
 
   In essence, SNA HIF has the feature of allowing users to eliminate the 
   sysgen defined Inactivity Time-out value during logon to the the HIF.  If 
   the graphic character representing the Application ID (line No.) is in the
   range of 50-5F, the user will have a Class 2 status and the originally 
   defined ITIMOUT is reset to 0.

ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   How large can the parameter governing the size of the primary session pool 
   be?



ANSWER:

   Each session requires 112 bytes of memory.  Using our lab version and the
   code generated I calculated the value to be 6,959.  However the calculation
   must have been a little off.  Once I tried to gen with this value RAM 
   displayed a message giving the maximun value to be 6,838.

   The restriction on this parameter will be governed by your availability of
   core for RAM.

   What happens when data is lost between HIF and TIF?

   Error correction is done locally, between the HIF and the host, and between
   the TIF and the UTS stations connected to it.  So the HIF/TIF only sends
   what it thinks is error-free data.

   The TIF and HIF are essentially independent from one another.  The way that
   the HIF/TIF will detect a data loss problem at the other end or in an 
   intermediate node will be the reciept of an ISIS message - Black Ball or 
   Zap.

   If data is lost in the network, a Black Ball is sent (i.e. replaces lost 
   data) in the same direction as the original data.

   If the TIF receives a Black Ball, it:
        - sends "NETWORK CIRCUIT LOST" to the appropriate terminal.
        - zaps circuit.

   In Early Data Forwarding, 1 large message coming into the HIF can be split
   into smaller, self-contained, correctly formatted Univac messages and 
   shipped off before the entire mainframe message has been received.
   Therefore, you can have the situation where part of the EDF'ed message gets
   received properly by the TIF (and sent -> terminal), but the rest of the 
   mainframe message is lost.

   If the HIF receives a Black Ball, it will clear table entries related to 
   the device associated with theis circuit - freeing buffers queued to this 
   device, etc.

   If the circuit gets zapped:

        SVC - user must redial
        PVC - Circuit automatically rebuilds.  User will detect problem in
              this case by a pause and "NETWORK CIRCUIT LOST" on the screen.

      Although it is still in limited release, there is a known bug in
   v.41.04 which can cause future problems, yet be easily avoided.  The 
   DEFNOD statement generally is of the format:

   DEFNOD ((NTYP,ADR,NUM),(NTYP,ADR,NUM),(NTYP,ADR,NUM))

   Normally, one would fill in the type of node (NTYP=BASE,REMOTE, or TII),
   the maximum node number (ADR) for that type, and the expected node count
   (NUM) of that type.  A typical statement might be:

   DEFNOD ((BASE,11,2),(REMOTE,1001,1),(TII,3000,200))

   In this particular version of code, the filling of the ADR parameters in 
   the BASE and REMOTE definitions causes the unusual problem of allowing a 
   network operator to shut lines (ESHUT), but not unshut (RSHUT) them again.

   So, for version 41.04 the ADR parameters must be allowed to default in the
   BASE and REMOTE definitions as follows:

   DEFNOD ((BASE,,2),(REMOTE,,1),(TII,3000,200))

   Of course, if you have no Tymnet I Bases (i.e. you have upgraded all your 
   gateways to TII) and you have no TI Remotes, then these definitions may be
   omitted:

   DEFNOD ((TII,3000,200))

   I.   Types of certifications
 
        A. Third Party Software
           1. terminal emulations
           2. file transfer
 
        B. Terminal which emulates another terminal for which a
           macro has already been developed.
 
   II.  The certification must be approved for field testing
        by contacting Dirk Heartman in Product Marketing.  His
        Ontyme name is NSMS.D/HEARTMAN.
 
   III. Contact Mary Arnett in Quality Assurance and provide 
        the following information. Ontyme QSATS.M/ARNETT.
 
        A. The name of the product to be tested.
        B. Information on the type of testing to be done (See
           Section I), including the type of terminal(s) emulated.
 
   IV.  If the terminal emulated is not one provided for in our CMT
        demo facility, or if file transfer requires that some other
        host than Fremont be targeted, a special slot will have to
        be provided for the testing.
 
   V.   The field person doing the testing must obtain the Certifi-
        cation Procedures Document from Quality Assurance, the
        CMTERM.ERS manual, and the document for the product being
        tested.
 
   VI.  Using the procedure described in the product document, set
        up the terminal emulation with the features defined in the
        CMTERM.ERS manual under "Set Up".
    
   VII. At this point testing becomes a matter of following the
        procedures outlined in the Certification Procedures
        Document.
    
   VIII.Once the testing is complete, the results should be care-
        fully documented.  The exact configuration(s) tested 
        and any problems encountered should be described.  Also,
        any differences between the CMTERM.ERS documentation 
        and the product tested should be noted.  For example,
        the terminal emulated may support a printer, but the
        emulation of that terminal may not.  We would also like to 
        have the steps necessary to access the program.
 
   IX.  Once the documentation is complete, all of the information,
        and the software package or terminal should be sent to Quality
        Assurance for final test.
 
   X.   Quality Assurance will be responsible for the final test and
        documentation.
 
   XI.  The final documentation will be sent to Product Marketing
        by QA, and there it will be added to the list of certified
        products.

We've got two new capabilities coming out in July and we need more beta
test customers...

  Pooled Addressing for Printers

    Our Async-to-3270 Bisync Service now supports CRM 4 addressing.  This
    means that customers with printers no longer need unique usernames for
    every printer, i.e., one-to-one addressing is no longer a requirement.
    Users with attached printers will be able to share usernames.  This
    also means significant reductions in memory requirements when alot of
    printers need to be supported.

    (Note: this capability is supported by our 3270 Bisync HIF ONLY.  CRM 4
    SNA/SDLC support is targetted for the end of the year in beta test.)


  System Request Key

    This is an important capability for alot of Async-to-3270 SNA/SDLC 
    customers.  The Sys Req Key is a button on a 3270 that allows a user
    who is talking to an application (LU) on their host to switch to the
    System Services Control Point (SSCP).  The SSCP enables them to then
    login to other applications, i.e., it provides a multi-application
    access capability.



If you have a customer who wants to beta test either of these capabilities,
send an Ontyme to Mary Chalmers (NSMS.M/Chalmers) with the following info:

  1. Beta test suitability.  Does the customer have the resources, expertise,
     and commitment to be an effective beta test site?

  2. Customer Equipment.  What type of host hardware and system software
     (e.g., TSO, CICS, IMS) do they have?  What types of terminals, PCs,
     and printers?

  3. Tymnet support.  Can a CC be assigned with sufficient time and experience
     to conduct a productive test?  (contact your RTM)

  4. Target install date you would like.

   publicly shared X.PC Network Servers (host #4463) or order their own
   dedicated servers (with different host number), through the normal
   order entry process.  As with all full release products, product
   marketing approval is no longer required to process an X.PC order.

   There is no impact on your existing X.PC customers.

   You can retrieve any information regarding X.PC by typing "LIST ***
   XPC.ALL" on Ontyme.
