                         1 -  SDLC VERSION 2.02 SYSGEN ERRORS







        Written by : Ping Chu, HQ Network Staff Consultant
              Date : October 06, 1986







        This  memo  lists a  number  of inconsistent  definitions  between SDLC
        version 2.02 SYSGEN document and INIT file.  Please use the recommended
        ways to get around the gen errors.


        1.  MAPADDR macor is only required in TIF as stated in sysgen 
            manual.  However, it gives error message if not coded in the 
            HIF tymfile.  One way to circumvent the error message is to 
            also define it in the HIF tymfile even though it is redundant.


        2.  PVC.RTPUT and PVC.TTPUT macros, if coded in the LINE level, will
            give PVC Configuration Error status in the PVC RESPONSE packet.
            To get around this error condition, we need to define these
            two macros in the PU level temporarily until they get fixed in
            the INIT file.


        3.  POLLTIMER macro defines T timer value at 1/4 second. The INIT file
            should be changed to REMARK as T timer value times 1/4 second, as
            opposed to a second currently.


        4.  NETREPLYTO macro defines T timer value at 1/10 second. The INIT
            file should then be changed to REMARK as T timer value times 1/10
            second, as opposed to a second currently.


        5.  For a PVC line, it gives error message when DHOST macor is defined
            in the LINE level even though the sysgen manual permits it to be
            defined in the LINE level. To circumvent this problem temporarily,
            we need to define it in the PU level.

                                           1                         MMDDYY.TIP
        SDLC VERSION 2.02 SYSGEN ERRORS                        October 27, 1986


        6.  In the sysgen manual, the MGOODGUY macro of SDLC Op monitor should
            not only define the USERNAME but also the AUTHORIZATION LEVEL, 
            which allows the user to DISPLAY or CHANGE SDLC network infor-
            mation.


        7.  In the sample tymfile of SDLC 2.02, the comments on LINE 0 of 
            GROUP 0 and LINE 1 of GROUP 1 are totally reversed.  LINE 0 of 
            GROUP 0 should be an Incoming PVC line, and LINE 1 of GROUP 1 
            should be an Outgoing PVC line.

        Effective  10/15,  TMCS version 10.10 will no longer be supported.

        Problems   with   this   product have  recently   been   discovered  by
        Tymnet   Headquarters,   which   will  present   difficulties   to  our
        customer base. (Please see attached ontyme from Shiao-Ming Tsui).

        TMCS  version  10.20  is  now in  full  release.   Please  upgrade your
        customer to this version.  The only restriction with TMCS Version 10.20
        is that it does not support Tymnet-I technology.  Version 10.00 will be
        the last version to support T-I.

        If  you have  any questions or concerns,   please send me an  Ontyme or

        UNSUPPORTED TMCS VERSION 10.10                         October 27, 1986








        [By Shiao-Ming Tsui, HQ Network Staff Consultant]



        The status of TMCS version 10.10 is being reviewed at this time.   If a
        private network  is only  using $ENABLE TYMNETONE  option for  the TMCS
        slot,  STS  recommends TMCS  '10.00'  over TMCS  10.10.   The following
        outstanding bugs have been found in TMCS 10.10:

          -  SET and CLEAR HOST LOCATION commands are not working correctly.
             If a host location has been set wrong, the host location
             cannot be reset or cleared.
          -  The five digit accounting host number is not reported correctly.
          -  Some out lines are not in the DISPLAY LINE output.
          -  In SINGLE_HOST_STATUS_MESSAGE facility, SET HOST MESSAGE command
             cannot set a new message over the old one if the host already
             has one host status message.

        TMCS 10.20 has the following facilities available:

          - SHUT_LINK_TABLE_MAINTENANCE facility copies the Shut Link Table
            from the active Sup to the inactive Sups.
          - Accepts 5 digit node numbers.
          - New formats on the log messages for OnTyme, RAM, Kernel, TMCS
            XCOM, and MXP.
          - Multiple host status message
          - Corrects the bugs listed above, with TMCS, Version 10.10

        TMCS 10.10 also has the problem  that you CAN NOT make mistakes  in the
        SET/CLEAR HOST LOCATION commands.  Once  a mistake is made in  the host
        location  file,  the problem  cannot  be cleared  until  TMCS  10.20 is
        loaded.  Then the host locations  which have been set wrong need  to be
        manually entered again.  TMCS 10.00 does not have this problem.


        TMCS version 10.20  does not support T-I.   TMCS Version 10.00  will be
        the last version to support T-I.


        Due to these concerns, STS recommends the use of TMCS version  10.00 or
        10.20 over version 10.10.

                        Date : October 07, 1986






        ORIGINAL QUESTION:



        Can you supply me with  an explanation of the record in  the accounting
        file for record "type 1, subtype E and F":

        1E1002D <- this work is followed by zero
        1F1002F <- same





        RESPONSE:



        Record Type 1, subtype E, indicates a gap in invoice numbers due to the
        initialization of the Sup,  INITA.  The invoice number in  this message
        is 1002D... indicating that it is from 2001.

        Record Type 1, subtype F, indicates that this invoice number  refers to
        a command  circuit.  It will  not be followed  by any  further reports,
        i.e.  character  counts,  etc.  This  invoice  number  is  1002F, again
        indicating that the message is from 2001.

        will assume that level  of authority. The National Telecom  Manager may
        escalate  to  the  FSC  President  as  necessary  in  the  event  of VP
        unavailable.

        Any upgrade in severity  level by the control group  requires immediate
        notification to the FSC Network Operations Manager.

        Control  groups that  require ticket  monitoring beyond  24  hours will
        refer the ticket to themselves for that purpose.

        NEW CERTIFICATION PROGRAM  --  ENHANCED SECURITY DEVICES




        A  couple  months ago,  Marketing  and NTS  began  a  new certification
        program for  enhanced security  devices that can  be used  with Tymnet.
        The following is an explanation of what these new technologies  are and
        a description of the first product to complete certification.



        Security Technologies
        -------- ------------

        There  are  a  number  of  technologies  that  this  program   will  be
        addressing.  The first of these, "token" based security devices, we are
        moving ahead with  full steam.  The next,  security-call-back, requires
        the use of Public Outdial and will emerge as that new  service emerges.
        The third, encryption for async dialup devices accessing  hosts through
        the network,  is longer term  and will require  the development  of new
        products that are not currently on the market.


        "Token" Based Security Devices

        This  is new  and exciting  stuff.   There are  at least  a  half dozen
        vendors introducing products  with this techology  now.  Each one  is a
        little different  but they  are all implementations  of the  same basic
        idea.  The common  goal is to give  every user a unique  "token" device
        that they  must have in  their possession when  they attempt  to access
        their host system or they don't get in.


                                          18                         MMDDYY.TIP
        ENHANCED SECURITY DEVICES                              October 27, 1986


        The way they  work is the  following.  All users  who wish to  access a
        host system are  issued a unique token  device.  These devices  come in
        all shapes and sizes.  Some look like little calculators.   Others look
        like credit cards with small LED displays.  And still others  are small
        boxes that  are attached between  the user's terminal  or PC  and their
        modem.

        At the host side is a  front-end box that can be connected to  a Tymnet
        Asynchronous Host Interface (Async Tymcom) and to the host itself via a
        series of  async ports.  (Some  vendors are developing  X.25 interfaces
        and host based software systems that can use X.25.)

        When a  user logs into  Tymnet, we connect  them to the  front-end box.
        Then the following happens:

          1) The front-end box prompts the user to identify themselves, 
             e.g., requests that they enter a username and password.

          2) If the user is successfully identified, the box will send 
             the user a randomly generated number (usually around six 
             digits long).

          3) For the "calculator-like" token devices, the user reads the 
             number off their screen and enters it into the calculator.

          4) The calculator then encrypts the number, using an algorithm 
             and seed that only it and the front-end box know, producing 
             a new number.

          5) Finally, the user sends the new number to the  front-end box to
             prove that he is in possession of the token device issued to him.

          6) Concurrently the host encrypts the same random number.  If the
             encrypted numbers match, the front-end box lets them access the 
             host system.


        Other token products do essentially the same thing.  Some  vendors have
        found ways to eliminate some of the manual entering and  re-entering of
        data.  Others provide various bells and whistles that the others don't.

        Below is a  brief description of the  product line of  MicroFrame, Inc.
        which we have certified.  You  can see some of the  possible variations
        on this common theme that they have done.


        Security-Call-Back

        This is a mature, tried-and-true security method.  What is new  is that
        we will be able to support it soon on Tymnet using Public Outdial.

        Basically,  security-call-back works  as follows.   A front-end  box is


                                          19                         MMDDYY.TIP
        ENHANCED SECURITY DEVICES                              October 27, 1986


        (again) required  at the user's  host site.  Users  login to  this box,
        identify themselves, and  then hang up.   The front-end box  then calls
        them back  at a  pre-established phone number  (using Outdial)  to make
        sure that they are who they  claim to be, e.g., that they are  not some
        kid making a call from their bedroom.

        We are currently working with two vendors who plan to develop security-
        call-back front-end boxes that  can work with Public Outdial.   (By the
        way, these same front-end  boxes can also support the  "token" security

        few months.



        MicroFrame Certification
        ---------- -------------

        The following is  a brief description  of the MicroFrame  "token" based
        product line  that we  have certified.  A  more detailed  and technical
        announcement will be coming out soon.

        MicroFrame's front-end  box that goes  at the host  site is  called the
        Datalock 4000.  They also offer three types of end-user  token devices.
        The first of these, the  PassKEY, is a small calculator-like  device as
        described above.  The other two are boxes that are attached between the
        user's  terminal  or PC  and  their async  dialup  modem.   These boxes
        perform similar kinds of number exchanges and number encryptions as the
        PassKEY except that they do it automatically without user intervention.
        The  way  they  differ  is  the  means  by  which  the  human  end-user
        "activates" the  box.  Their first  product, the DataKEY,  requires the
        user  to  unlock the  device  using  a data  encoded  key.   The second
        product,  the MagnaKEY,   requires the  user to  run their  credit card
        through a  reader built into  the box.  The  PassKEY is  obviously more
        mobile  and less  expensive.  The  DataKEY and  MagnaKEY are  more user
        friendly.

                          7 -  PUBLIC OUTDIAL - Status Update







        Written by : Gordon Smith, Product Marketing
              Date : October 10, 1986 






        Here's the latest status:



          * Last night we loaded the new Consat/Outdial code into the Dallas 
            2400 bps rotary.  We expect to get the remaining four cities of 
            the first round October deployment (Houston, New York, San Jose, 
            and Kansas City) up in the next couple of weeks.  (As some of you
            may have heard, we hit a snag when we attempted to bring up the 
            first site a couple weeks ago.  That problem has been resolved,
            and we are now proceeding.)

          * The (Preliminary) Public Outdial User Manual is now done.  It is 
            available on Ontyme *** Outdial.User/Manual  (caution: it is 
            rather lengthy).

          * Two other Ontyme files have also been set up.  *** Public.Outdial
            is a copy of the beta test announcement sent out a few weeks ago.
            It contains all sorts of useful information.  The other is 
            *** Outdial.  Validations which describes how Public Outdial user-
            names are being set up (thanks Vida).

          * The November Public Outdial expansion cities have been selected. 
            They are:
                 Denver
                 Miami
                 Detroit
                 Atlanta
                 Boston

            We plan to add five more cities in December/January, but have not
            yet finalized the list.  (There is still time to provide input.)

        Lastly,   Bob   Fultz   will   be   taking   over   Product  Management
        responsibilites for Public Outdial.  All questions, concerns, requests,
        etc. should be addressed to him.  I have decided to move on.   Today is
        my last day at Tymnet.

        This has been a long but very enjoyable and rewarding project.  It gave
        me an opportunity to work with some of the best people in Tymnet.  Alot
        of people went "above and beyond  the call of duty" on this one  - alot
        of  hard  work.  In  particular,  I'd  like to  thank  Dede  Cash, Fred
        Canning, Bob Barone, Dennis Moulton,  and Phil Leever of MIS  for their
        many long  hours.  Scott Wedel,  Chris Black, and  Dan Lasater  for the
        quality of  their work  and professionalism  - NTD  at it's  best.  Ron
        Vivier, Ed  Blair, August  Cattaneo, and  Jim Stein  of NTS  for coming
        through again and again and  again.  And Jack Snavely for  always being
        there  to drive  things through  Operations when  the going  got tough.
        Thanks.

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:



        MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE NUMBER REPRESENTING 'CIRCUITS  TERMINATING' ON
        THE FRONT ENGINE  CONSOLE.  IS THIS  ONLY A REPRESENTATION  OF CIRCUITS
        THAT  ORIGINATE OUTSIDE  NODE  3646, MEANING  A USER  DIALS  THE PUBLIC
        ACCESS  NUMBER AND  LOGS INTO  THEIR X.25,  3270/CMT  INTERFACES.  WHAT
        ABOUT THE CIRCUITS THAT ORIGINATE  OUT OF THEIR ATI-8 SLOT?   I BELIEVE
        THESE  CIRCUITS DO  NOT GO  THROUGH  SLOT 0,  WHICH IS  WHAT  THE FRONT
        CONSOLE INDICATES IT IS MONITORING BY THE INDICATION AT THE FAR LEFT OF
        THE CONSOLE,THEREFORE, ARE THEY NOT INCLUDED IN THE CIRCUIT TERMINATING
        INDICATION?

        A CUSTOMER WAS TRYING  TO DO A TEST TO  SEE IF THIS NUMBER WAS  TRUE TO
        ACTUAL USERS LOGGED ON, HOWEVER, WAS FINDING IT TO BE OFF BY ONE OR TWO
        AT TIMES.

        PLEASE GIVE ME A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CIRCUITS ARE, OR  ARE NOT,
        COUNTED IN THE CIRCUIT TERMINATING COUNTER.






        RESPONSE:



        The number for  circuits terminating is  the count of  virtual circuits


                                          24                         MMDDYY.TIP

        that  terminate  on this  node  (through nodecode).   It  includes both
        active nodecode dispatcher ports and active kernel ports.  Kernel ports
        are DDT users;  dispatcher ports are slot  circuits.  Xray counts  as a
        kernel port only when it is accessed through DDT slot 0.

        In summary, the variations you noticed are caused by DDT circuits.

        Written by : Sandra Nilluka, HQ Network Staff Consultant
              Date : Octiber 13, 1986






        SYMPTOM:  Unexplainable Crashes

        PROBLEM:  CPU and/or MAC Register Corruption.
                  CPU and MAC registers degrade over a period of time; they
                  must be reloaded periodically.

        SOLUTION:  Store and reload the registers periodically.  This must be
                   performed by the kernel, as it requires privileged mode.

                   The function is implemented in recently released Isis patch
                   files listed below:
                       (SOURCE)I2IS05.Q08
                       (SOURCE)I2IS07.Q00
                        (QSATS)I2IS07.PAC
                  Please incorporate this patch into ALL Isis kernels, as
                  follows:
                     .for version 5.08, re-gen.
                     .for version 7.00, re-gen.
                     .for version 7.03, add ;A(QSATS)I2IS07.PAC and re-gen.

                  This function is not yet implemented in Nodecode for Solo
                  kernels, such as Switchers and Solo Consats.


        CIRCUMVENTION:  For nodecode Solo kernels, there is none; code changes
                        are required.  A tech alert will be issued upon avail-
                        ability of solution for nodecode Solo kernels.

                  11 -  SOLO NODE DOES NOT RECOVER FROM POWER FAILURE







        Written by : Sandra Nilluka, HQ Network Staff Consultant
              Date : October 13, 1986






        SYMPTOM:  Solo Node does not recover from power failure.

        PROBLEM:  CPU register are unreliable upon power-up; register E of
                  set D, the 3600-baud interrupt timer, causes an illegal
                  instuction interrupt if it is negative, and can be upon
                  power-up.  If so, the node will continuously crash, and
                  will drop out of the network.

        SOLUTION:  In power-up logic, immediately ensure that register E of
                   set D is not in danger of going negative, by loading a
                   large positive number into it.

                   This is implemented in the following recently released
                   patch files:
                     (SOURCE)TII05.P10
                     (QSATS)TII05.PAA

                     (QSATS)TII05.PAD

                   Please incorporate this fix into ALL your Solo nodes,
                   Switchers or Solo Consats, as follows:
                    .for Nodecode 5.06, add ;A(QSATS)TII05.PAA and re-gen.
                    .for Nodecode 5.07, add ;A(QSATS)TII05.PAB and re-gen.
                    .for Nodecode 5.10, re-gen.
                    .for Nodecode 5.11, add ;A(QSATS)TII05.PAD and re-gen.

        and  version 6.01  consat with  IIX capabilities.   The x.25  slot will
        most  likely lose  (crash) if  it receives  an IIX  capable  call.  For

        RAM GENERATES INCOMPLETE RECORDS                       October 27, 1986






                        14 -  RAM GENERATES INCOMPLETE RECORDS







        Written by : Shirley Chiang, Mgr. Interface Support Dept.
              Date : October 21, 1986 







        There  have been  some misconceptions  on how  RAM (the  Raw Accounting
        Merger) handles  the raw data  merge process and  how it  generates the
        incom plete records.

        The following, three, situations have been frequently observed but mis-
        understood  as  'anomalies' from  RAM  data by  the  customers  and our
        technical support people.  They were:

            1.  Quite a few session records without any information but
                the session/invoice number.

            2.  Large number of incomplete session records with only the 
                start/stop, date/time, connect time and i/o character count.

            3.  Erroneous node numbers appeared in the records.  These node 
                numbers did not exist in the network.

            Here is the scenario:


        I.  Situation #1 -
        ------------------

        These  types  of  records  are  sessions  built  for  command circuits.
        Supervisor  only generates  accounting  preamble message  (type  1) for
        command  circiuts and  mark  the IRC  code in  msg.  type #1  as  0F to
        indicate such a  session.  Therefore there  will not be  any accounting
        data for the  command circuit sessions.   Usually this type  of session

        RAM GENERATES INCOMPLETE RECORDS                       October 27, 1986


        ------------------


        Usually the large number of incomplete records were created by frequent
        use  of  the DRAIN  command  and  by the  execution  of  checkpoint; an
        interval set up  in RAM's tymfile parameter  CHKPT to allow  RAM check-
        point the long,  enduring sessions out of  the memory to tape.   If the
        customer's  checkpoint interval has been set too short, it  would cause
        much  of  the  session records  to  be  written to  tape  prior  to the
        termination information being collected.

        Let me briefly  explain a little bit  about RAM's collection  and merge
        process and reasons for the occurrence of incomplete records.



                 RAM's collection & merge process:

                 -  Request raw acct. data blocks from Account Slave
             
                 -  Create, in the memory resident Session Pool, an entry per
                     session number/invoice number
                 
                 -  Keep updating each entry (session record) with information
                     such as i/o character count until termination information
                     is collected for the session.  Then it marks the record 
                     as complete (position 2, value = 1) and write to tape

                 -  Under four circumstances, incomplete records are generated
                     and written to tape:

                    1.  32 minutes elapsed after the last updated infor. for 
                        the session has been collected and still no termina-
                        tion info. followed in.  RAM marks this record as 
                        "incomplete" (position 2, value = 2) and flags it as 
                        "missing log-out infor." (position 238, value = 1).  
                        In the mean time, RAM also artificially generates a 
                        termination code of 83.

                    2.  A session lasted longer than the check point interval 
                        set by the CHKPT tymfile parmete.  RAM holds in the 
                        pool and keeps updating to the record until it reaches 
                        the check-point time, the record is then written to 
                        tape, flagged as "incomplete", "missing log-out" and 
                        possibly "missing log-in" (position 237, value = 1), 
                        and as "check-pointed" (position 236, value = 1)

                    3.  When Session Pool is full, RAM will be paused.
                        No more collection can continue and the pool
                        must be drained.  During the draining, RAM writes
                        all the records currently holding in the pool to 
                        tape and flags them as "incomplete", "missing log-in",
                        and "missing log-out".

                                          32                         MMDDYY.TIP
        RAM GENERATES INCOMPLETE RECORDS                       October 27, 1986


          
                    4.  More updates to an on-going session are still being 
                        collected after it had already been written to tape 
                        (caused by one of the three previously described 
                        conditions).  Now RAM has to create a new entry 
                        (though not a new session) in the pool which 
                        apparently won't have any log-in information.  If this
                        record is check-pointed or drained again before its 
                        termination information is collected, it will be 
                        flagged as "incomplete", "missing log-in", "missing 
                        log-out" or "check-pointed".

                   The complete information for a session may be contained in
                   one primary record or one set of the primary and secondary
                   records or it may be scattered in several incomplete records
                   on the same tape or across multiple tapes.


        I  strongly suggest  the  Field CC  convey this  concept  of incomplete
        record  processing  to  the  customer.   Customer  billing applications
        should be designed to accomodate the above mentioned conditions  and be
        able to consolidate multi-record sessions.


        III.Situations #3 -
        -------------------

        I suspect this may be caused by some kind of problem conditions  on the
        gateway nodes  as one-shot problem.   This is strictly  my speculation.
        I'd like to  see a ticket opened  against the interface it  involves as
        soon as this problem reoccurs.


        IV.  Final suggestion:
        ----------------------

          -  Lengthen the checkpoint interval.  For example, from 2 hours to
             9 hours, CHKPT(4) should be changed to CHKPT(12) in RAM tymfile.

          -  Enlarge the size of the primary and/or secondary session pool by
             adjusting the values of MXSES0 and MXSES1 parameters in RAM
             tymfile.  Be sure you do not exceed the slot memory allocation
             in doing so.


        After incoperating the  changes in your gen  and reloading the  slot, a
        dramatic  decrease  in  the  number  of  incomplete  records  should be
        expected.

        Let me know if you still have questions on this matter.

        Original Question by : Carol Anderson, Field CC
                 Response by : Adea Lee, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                        Date : October 15, 1986






        ORIGINAL QUESTION:

        "IS IT  TRUE THAT  THE SDLC  EXTENSION CORD  ONLY SUPPORTS  HALF DUPLEX
        TRANSMISSION?   IF  SO, DOES  ANOTHER  WAY EXIST  TO  SUPPORT  THE MSNF
        CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SNA NETWORKS?"

        IT IS  MY UNDERSTANDING THAT  IT IS CORRECT  THAT WE SUPPORT  ONLY HALF
        DUPLEX MODE WITH OUR SDLC PRODUCT FROM A PROTOCOL STANDPOINT,  BUT THAT
        THE  ACTUAL  TRANSMISSION  MEDIUM   IS  FULL  DUPLEX.   WHAT   ARE  THE
        IMPLICATIONS OF THIS LIMITATION.   DOES THIS SAME RESTRICTION  APPLY TO
        OUR SNA PRODUCT?


        RESPONSE:

        In response to your  question, regarding full-duplex mode, our  SDLC or
        SNA  products currently  do not  support full-duplex  mode  in protocol
        level. By protocol level, I mean the software not the  hardware (actual
        transmission media). In other words, SDLC or SNA interface can only run
        half-duplex in software level, but can run either half-duplex  or full-
        duplex in hardware level.

        Two  macros  are involved  in  SDLC  or SNA  interface  to  specify the
        half/full duplex mode:

        ****For hardware transmission, use RTSCTS macro--
            RTSCTS(yes) ---half-duplex
            RTSCTS(no)  ---full-duplex

        ****For software level, use DATAMODE macro --
            DATAMODE(half) --half-duplex
            DATAMODE(full)---full-duplex

        Original RFI by: Mike Hofbauer
            Written by : John Mckiernan, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                  Date : October 15, 1986






        1:  The average CPS rate per device is as follows -

            Each transaction is 1431 bytes total.
            Each device enters 16 such per hour.

            (1431 * 16) / 3600 = 6.36 CPS per device

        2:  For your worst case interface configuration, given the
            above, the interface CPS rate is as follows -

            08 lines w/ 04 CU's each (04 DEV/CU)

            (8 * 4 * 4) * 6.36 = 814.08 CPS

            A more likely interface configuration is perhaps -

            06 lines w/ 03 CU's each (02 DEV/CU)

            (6 * 3 * 2) * 6.36 = 228.96 CPS

            If you wish to pursue further testing, please detail
            the environment which must be simulated.

        3:  A potential Node Code 'link saturation' problem can be
            seen in the worst case configuration if the connection
            to the neighbor node is 9600 BPS or less .  You will
            see below why I recommend using 19200 BPS lines.

        4:  If the concentration of ISIS nodes to SWITCHER nodes
            is 12 to 01 , then each SWITCHER node will handle a
            user data throughput of 2747.52 CPS , assuming use
            of the lower interface CPS figure given above.

                                          37                         MMDDYY.TIP

            12 * 228.96 = 2747.52 CPS


        Using the above, it would be possible to simulate the
        environment of the proposed network, with minor limits
        on the accuracy.  The major obstacle to this testing is
        the hardware requirements (04 nodes minimum) .  I do not
        have these available to me and will request either QA or
        NTD to provide them in the future if required.  Testing
        will require agreements with 'resource managers' in HQ
        or QA or NTD .  Please indicate your need for further
        studies.

        To return to your previous question of a network delay
        less than 03 seconds, it seems highly unlikely that we
        can meet that objective for the following reasons -

        1:  Serialization of the 'typical' transaction you have
            provided requires the following times at various
            line speeds -

            1200 MS at  9600 BPS
             600 MS at 19200 BPS
             204 MS at 56000 BPS

        2:  Typical 'holding time' for the involved nodes will
            be approximately 100 MS .  This is allowing at most
            02 Foreground units and 01 Background unit.  Each of
            these units is 25 MS and 50 MS respectively.  Times
            for this represent the queueing and processing delay
            introduced by each involved node beyond the delays of
            line serialization.

        3:  For various configurations as you provided or as may
            be advisable, the overall 'network delay' would be
            (at least) the following -

            CU -- IN -- SW -- SW -- IN -- FE

            NOTE - 'CU' means Customer device
                   'FE' means Customer system
                   'IN' means ISIS     Node
                   'SW' means SWITCHER Node
                   '--' means serialized line

            If - All interface lines            are  9600 BPS
                 All Node Code lines (IN to SW) are  9600 BPS
                 All Node Code lines (SW to SW) are 56000 BPS

                 (1200 * 04) + 204 + (100 * 04) = 5404 MS

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:



        MY  CUSTOMER IS  INTERESTED IN  TYMNET'S SUPPORT  OF  MSNF CONNECTIONS.
        THEY ARE AWARE  THAT WE SUPPORT  MSNF WITH THE  SDLC PRODUCT IN  A HALF
        DUPLEX  MODE  ONLY  AND  ARE  LOOKING  FOR  AN  ALTERNATIVE.  ALTHOUGH,
        DEPENDING  UPON THE  APPLICATION,  I DO  NOT PERCEIVE  THE  HALF DUPLEX
        LIMITATION TO BE OVERLY SIGNIFICANT,  I WOULD LIKE YOUR INPUT  PRIOR TO
        RESPONDING  TO  THE CUSTOMER.   IT  IS MY  UNDERSTANDING  THAT  MNSF IS
        UNNECESSARY WITH TYMNET'S SNA.   I DO NOT HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF MSNF
        AND  WOULD LIKE  A  COMPREHENSIVE EXPLANATION  OF HOW  TYMNET  CAN BEST
        SUPPORT THIS REQUIREMENT.



        RESPONSE:



        IBM's MSNF  is a host  based software facility  that allows  a terminal
        attached to  one IBM host  to "passthru" to  another IBM host  and work
        with  an application on that host.  While the SDLC product  can support
        a  host-to-host connection,  most Tymnet  networks prefer  to  have the
        switching done in the network.  The SNA HIF eliminates the need for the
        customer to  link together its  mainframes with MSNF  or the  newer SNI
        software from IBM  because the network  does all the  switching between
        different hosts.   Both MSNF and SNI are very intensive to  install and
        maintain and that is one of the major reasons why Tymnet is a very good
        alternative for getting users into multiple IBM hosts.

        If you have chosen for some  reason to implement CRSTOP in any  of your
        interface code, please  note that upon a  crash, there is no  change of
        status message  for the  host sent to  Isis and  therefore to  Probe or
        TMCS.

        In the case of customers  who are heavily dependent upon NSSC  for host
        monitoring, this means that they will not realize that a slot  has gone
        down, and the customer will not be notified.

        If you  are tracking  a particular problem,  and the  use of  CRSTOP is
        recommended, then go ahead and install it.  It is recommended, however,
        that  once the  problem is  resolved, CRSTOP  be removed  from  the now
        stable interfaces.

        Two new features have been added to PATCH FILE SYSTEM.
         
        1. User can run patch file system in his current directory, on system
           56, by entering 'RUN (techref)PATCH' as opposed to: 'gfd 
           (techref:56) and entering 'RUN PATCH'.
         
        2. Added a field to show the version number in the summary report 
           'REPORT.P01'.

        The latest versions  of the Isis 5.08  and 7.00 patch file  contained a
        patch to correct a problem  with degrading registers.  It has  now been
        discovered that if  this patch is installed  on an engine  running high
        speed interrupts (BAUDR EQ 2) you will run the risk of garbage on async
        ports.   While  the fix  this  patch provides  is  needed,  its current
        implementation provides  too small of  a processing window  for heavily
        loaded async  engines.  At  this time, we  recommend that  for machines
        experiencing async port problems you regen the ISIS kernal.  A modified
        patch to provide a larger process window is currently being  tested and
        will be released soon.

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:



        THE SDLC MANUAL,  THAT I HAVE, TALKS  ABOUT REPLYTO AND RETRIES,  BUT I
        DON'T  FIND NETREPLYTO  .   CAN YOU  PROVIDE  ME WITH  A  MORE DETAILED
        EXPLANATION OF  EACH ONE OF  THESE TIMERS AND  HOW THE WORK  IN VERSION
        1.12?






        RESPONSE:


        I hope the following information helps:

        1) RETRIES macro --
           This macro is used in many places.
           At the TIF ---
           a) It counts the number of SNRMs sent to a CU.

           b) When a receive timeout ocurrs (specified by REPLTYO) during NRM,
              it counts the number of RRs sent to a CU. If the number of 
              receive timouts exceed the first argument of this macro, the TIF 
              will jump from NRM to NDM for that particular CU.
           

           At the HIF ---
           a) Only the first argument is used in the HIF.

                                          46                         MMDDYY.TIP
        RETRIES-NETREPLTO-REPLYTO MACROS                       October 27, 1986



           b) It counts the number of SNRMS ignored from the host in between
              SNRMs sent across the network. With RETRIES defined as (5,0,0) 
              at HIF, the HIF will sned one SNRM to the net. for every other 5
              SNRMs rcv'ed from the host. This is to avoid too many 
              unnecessary SNRMs to absorb the command list and to relieve the
              network traffic as well. The same implementation applies for XID 
              and TEST frames.

        2) NETREPLYTO macro ---
           This macro is only used at the HIF served as a netwrok receive 
           timer.  During NDM, this timer is set once a SNRM is sent across the
           network.  If the proper response comes back from the netwrok before 
           the timer expires:  The HIF will transmit the response out to the 
           host.

           If the proper response is not received when the timer expires :
              THe HIF will take the first argument of RETRIES macro as a 
              counter and decrease it by one. The HIF will jump from xmt. to 
              receive state on the link. It will then keep checking for a 
              response from the net. for every SNRM received on the link, but
              won't pass it to the network until the coutner reaches 0.

              The same implementation applies for XID and TEST frames. This 
              timer needs to bo set less than the host's SNRM polling rate.

        3) REPLYTO macro ---
           This is receive timer used at both TIF and HIF. It specifies how
           long each interface will stay in receive state before going to 
           transmit state. It is only used during NRM. When this timer expires,
           the retry counter (the first argument of RETRIES macro) will be 
           decreased by one.



        The SYSGEN and ERS manuals  have been revised lately by NTD  and should
        be  released  to  (DNDSPEC:33)  shortly.  When  these  two  manuals are
        available under sys 33, please  take a look at them becuase  the usages
        and definitions of the macros mentioned above are  described thoroughly
        in both manuals.
