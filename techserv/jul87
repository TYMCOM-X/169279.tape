                        Date : June 3, 1987






        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        What  is the  "login rate"  composed of?   Is it  the number  of logins
        attempted, even if not completed due to error in username  or password,
        or host  not available.  Does  it include ddt,  xray, or  other utility
        logins?


        The reason for  this question is  that we are  seeing about 2x  as many
        logins  reported in  Probe than  are being  reported in  the accounting
        statistics.






        RESPONSE:


        The Login Rate figure is the accumulation of the number of times during
        the  last minute  that we  went through  the Direct  Routine;  in other
        words,  calculated  a path  either  for a  regular  circuit,  a rebuilt
        circuit, or an  aux circuit.  Added to  this is the number  of internal
        circuits (aux circuits).


        Two points about this -- we do not go into the direct routine unless we
        have somewhere to go.  In other words, the destination host has already
        been checked to be answered, and the network username and  password has

        What is the Login Rate Composed Of                         July 2, 1987


        already been validated.  The second thing is that it appears to me that
        we count  aux circuits  twice, once  simply because  it is  an internal
        circuit and once when we actually decide which path to take.


        I don't  know what your  accounting data shows,  and I don't  know your
        network configuration, but  remember that to  the Login Rate  figure, a
        consat to cmt to pbh session is 2 logins.  All ddt, xray, etc. sessions
        are included.

             Following is the procedure to load an image file from
        PDP-10 to a DATA I/O:

           1. Connect DATA I/O and terminal with RS232.
           2. Make sure the baud rates are the same (for example both 1200).
           3. Power on DATA I/O and enter on front panel the following:
                 SELECT
                 81
                 ENTER
           4. Login to PDP-10 where the image file resides.
           5. Enter following command at terminal:

                 R (TOOLS11)BURN
              Burn is a program on (TOOLS11:39) which down line loads
              a prom image into a DATA I/O. It goes through a question
              and answer period and then loads the data into the
              prom burner.
           6. For the remaining steps and example, please refer to
              section 4 of document (TECHREF:38)ATC300.DOC.

                 Response by: John Mckiernan, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                       Date : June 18, 1987







        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        I am working on an SDLC/QLLC/X25 betatest and have 2 questions--


        1.  Is there  a way to  get the CALLED and  CALLING address to  be less
        than 14-digits (default).


        2.  My SVC is an OUTLN and  does NOT send a CALLING address in  the IIX
        call setup messages.  I can enter a calling address via the monitor and
        an IIX message gets sent out (of course, it defaults to 14-digits).  Is
        there a macro  whereby I can  gen a calling  address into the  code.  I
        cannot find this in the documentation.






        RESPONSE:


        For SDLC interface lines which originate network circuits, two   macros
        define the CALLED and CALLING address.  They are -

          SVC.CALLED()  - To define the CALLED  DTE X.121 address   
          SVC.CLGADR()  - To define the CALLING DTE X.121 address

        X.121 Address Options for SDLC/QLLC                        July 2, 1987


        Unfortunately, the second macro is not documented in the SDLC    (QLLC)
        SYSGEN reference manual.  I will discuss this with NTD .


        For SDLC interface lines which terminate network circuits, the   second
        macro is used to  verify the CALLING DTE  address.  If the  two  do not
        agree, the network circuit is cleared.


        Regarding the  optional use of  X.121 address which  are less  than  14
        digits in length, our  SDLC interface cannot accept a  'short'  address
        for INCOMING  lines.  This problem  was first identified    by External
        Network  Services  (ENS) ,  and  NTD is  investigating     the required
        solution.


        Our XCOM interfaces can accept any length CALLED or CALLING  address up
        through the maximum 14 digits.

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        I am  in the  process of upgrading  a Supervisor's  disks from  2 10-MB
        disks to a  300-MB disk.  What I  require, for this and  another future
        upgrade,  is  a  description of  the  disk  allocation  allocations and
        parameters used in the .DSC file for 10, 160, and 300 MB disks.






        RESPONSE:


        The main differences, code-wise, between the 10s and the 160s  and 300s
        are:


        1 - The 10s  use the .TYMfile paramter  NDISC to specify the  number of
        disk drives.  The  160s and 300s use  the .TYMfile parameter  MSCDSK to
        specify the number of disk controllers.


        2 - The 10s  have 2 platters, fixed  and removable.  The 160s  and 300s
        have just 1 platter.


        3  -  The  size  allocations,  i.e.  #sectors  per  track,  #tracks per


                                           6
        Disk Allocations/Parameters Used In The .DSC File          July 2, 1987


        cylinder, are defaulted  for the 10s.  You  must set them in  your .DSC
        file for the 160s and 300s.


        Differences in parameters between the 160s and 300s:


        1 - MSCTK0 or number of  tracks per cylinder.  For the 160s this  is EQ
        to $A 10.  For  the 300s it is $A  19.  The difference between  the two
        drives is  not the  number of cylinders,  but rather  the size  of each
        cylinder.


        Examples:


        (UL6CODE:37)ZZ2001.DSC is an example of a 160mb .DSCfile.


        (DIALNET:37)DI2001.DSC is an example of a 300mb .DSCfile.  Note however
        that this file has a mistake.  The USER SPACE should be  332 cylinders,
        not 335.  Never allocate the cylinder numbers above 332.


        Further information:


        See next page for an article on further descriptions of .DSC  files and
        their paramters.


        The  basic  procedures  for  determining  the  number  of  cylinders to
        allocate  remain the  same.  Always  do your  calculations  in decimal,
        round up, then  convert to hex.  The  number of cylinders =  (number of
        sectors)  / (number  of  sectors per  track)  * (number  of  tracks per
        cylinder).

        I.  Sup file structure and parameters

          i.  THE SUP AND UTILITY FILES

        There is only one parameter in the Isis .TYM file which  indicates that
        a node  is a  supervisor.  That  is SUP  EQ 1.   Setting this  causes a
        couple of things to happen:

                Isis will check to see that your node number is in the
                range of 2001-2007, and that your kernal host number is
                the appropriate one, 121-127.

                Isis will append 7 slots to your highest slot number,
                NSLOT, and calculates the core size of each.

                These seven slots are added in the following order:

                Slot Number             Product
                Q = NSLOT + 1           Supervisor
                Q = Q + 1               Probe
                Q = Q + 1               Error Log
                Q = Q + 1               Account
                Q = Q + 1               Sys Message
                Q = Q + 1               UN2
                Q = Q + 1               Utility

        The SUPERVISOR is an Isis slot which, along with its slaves, "controls"
        the network.   It handles  routing, username  verification, accounting,
        and network diagnostics/status.


        PROBE is the interactive  network monitoring program that serves  as an
        authorized user's interface to the network.


        The ERROR LOG slave has read-only addess to the network  diagnostic log
        on disk.


        The ACCOUNT slave has read-only access to the accounting data stored on
        disk.

        The SYS MESSAGE slave provides on-line messages to users  about network
        conditions.  It  also allows  changes in  the class/group  tables, host
        messages, and shut  lines for inactive sups  to be communicated  to the
        other supervisors in the network.


        UN2 allows the network user validations program to read and  modify the
        Master User Directory file on disk.  This slave allows all Sups to have
        a consistent view of the CUD.


        UTILITY handles disk-to-disk and tape-to-disk data transfers.

        iii.    THE .DSC FILE

        The .DSC file is divided into three general sections:  1. definition of
        the physical  media, 2. definition  of global units  and sizes,  and 3.
        definition of local (by slot) units and licenses.


        In general, all values are in hex.

        Sup File Structure and Parameters                          July 2, 1987


        Section 1, the physical media:

                The following must be defined in the .TYM file. 
                NDISC  = # 10mb drives
                NTAPE  = # tape drives
                MSCDSK = # MSC controllers

                The following should be in the .DSC file.
                MXGLU  = maximum number of global units as defined in 
                         Section 2.
                NMSCx  = number MSC drives on this controller
                MSCDAx = MSC controller number
                MSCCYx = cylinders per MSC drive
                MSCTKx = tracks per MSC cylinders
                MSCSTx = sectors per MSC track

                The size definitions for the 10mb and the tape drives 
                default.

                In decimal the various sizes of the disk drives are:

                                    10mb           160mb           300mb
        cyl/drive (format)       408(198x)       823(337x)       823(337x)
        cyl/drive (user)         403(193x)       818(332x)       821(335x)
        sectors/cyl               48( 30x)       530(212x)      1007(3efx)

                Any time cylinder calculations are done, it is safest to do 
                them in decimal, round up if there is a remainder, and then 
                convert to hex.

        Section 2, the global definitions, takes the following form:

                SGU.DEF(AA,BB,CC,DD,EE)

                AA = the global unit number
                BB = the device type (DK, MS, or MT)
                CC = the device number
                DD = the starting cylinder address of the unit 
                EE = the length (in cylinders) of the unit

                all values (except device type) are in hex

        Section 3, the local definitions:

                In this section, the global units assigned above are
                allocated to certain slots with certain degrees of license.  
                The format takes the following form:

                NXLUx = maximum number of logical units for slot x.
                        this must be greater than or equal to the highest 
                        local unit number as opposed to the actual number of 
                        units.

        Sup File Structure and Parameters                          July 2, 1987


                SEG.REF(FF,GG,AA,HH+HH...)

                FF = the slot number, for the utility slots this is set to
                     equal the previous slot number + 1

                GG = the logical unit number within the slot

                AA = the global unit number defined above

                HH = the various license types summed together.  These are:
                     RD = read
                     WR = write
                     AT = attach
                     SS = system

                As far as the licenses go, the safest bet is to find a 
                sample .DSC file and follow what is defined there.

                The following are local unit numbers which must remain
                constant due to code limitations.  In other words, the
                global numbering scheme may be whatever you want, but 
                within the slots themselves the value of FF (see above)
                must be the following:

                value of FF             area name
                     0                  Mud/Cud
                     1                  Accounting
                     2                  Supervisor Save Area
                     3                  Class and Group Definitions
                     4                  Source/Destination File
                     5                  Error Log
                     6                  Host Message
                     7                  Supervisor History
                     8                  (reserved)
                     9                  Regional Data Set
                    10                  Closure Work File

                If some of these areas are unused, the logical units
                must remain unused.

                                 Initialization Files


        An  initialization  file  is a  program  that  runs  automatically upon
        logging into a system.  The  init file can be programmed to  do various
        things such as  setting status, sending  commands to the  DEC mainframe
        such as:
             TTY LC     lower case letters
             TTY ERASE  cntrl a does a echoed backspace
             TTY BSD    cntrl h does a echoed backspace
              etc.

        The following  is a description  of how to  create an init  file.  This
        init file is for  System 25, 54 and  like Systems.  Not for  Ontyme.  I
        believe you will  find it worth the  modest trouble it takes  to create
        the init file.

        1) Copy (tymnet or tym5)init.tba and init.shr into your directory.

        2) copy (tymnet or tym5)pi into your directory.

        3) Use Peak to modify pi (Editor will not work properly); substitute
           your status user name for "codegen".

        4) Run the command noname (R Noname) and answer the prompts with the
           following information:
                change                     : let's change things
                13                         : change project code requirements
                n                          : no project code required
                y                          : good change
                y                          : more changes

                                        PATCH POLICY
         
                                 Issued:  February 10, 1986          
         
             
         
             A  primary responsibility of both Technical Services and Network 
             Technology Development is to resolve software anomalies.  One of 
             the  methods used to resolve an anomaly includes the  generation 
             of  a  temporary patch.   As Technical Services  does  not  have 
             responsibility   for   either   source   code   or   maintenance 
             programming,  the major decisions relating to the methodology of 
             a  cure lies with the Network Technology Division (NTD).   As  a 
             result, a close working relationship with NTD is required.  This 
             memo  attempts to set out the policy by which Technical Services 
             and NTD will deal with the broad issue of patches.
         
             While  Technical  Services may be able to write a  patch  for  a 
             specific  customer's needs,  their  major responsibility  is  to 
             ensure that NTD incorporates the change not only in the  version 
             which  demonstrates  the problem/need,  but all  future  product 
             releases.
         
             Software  patches  can be divided into  two  categories.   Those 
             required  to  resolve  an  anomaly in  the  software  and  those 
             required to implement a feature not in the software.
         
                  I.  Patches created as the result of a software anomaly are  
                  considered   as  a  necessary  element  of  the  Field  and  
                  Technical  Service's function.   The  following  procedures 
                  apply:
         
                      A. All patches will undergo as much testing as possible 
                         prior to installation in a network interface.
         
                      B  All  patches  generated  by the Field  or  Technical 
                         Services  must  be  delivered  to NTD  via  the  NSR 
                         process as an anomaly report.

                                          17
        Patch Policy                                               July 2, 1987


         
                      C. Technical  Services  will support and  maintain  all  
                         patches in an "ALPHA PATCH FILE" directory until NTD 
                         issues a new PATCH FILE release.
         
                      D. NTD  will incorporate the fix in the next release of 
                         source software whenever timing allows.
         
                      E. NTD   reserves  the  right  to  reject  an  NSR   or  
                         Escalation  of a problem with an accompanying  patch 
                         which has not been approved by NTD when NTD suspects 
                         the anomaly is associated with the patch.


                  II. Feature  required  as  the result of  a  Field/customer
                  request must be submitted to Technical Services for  review 
                  and  are  not  to  be installed into  a  network  interface 
                  without  the explicit consent of Technical  Services.   The 
                  following procedures apply:
         
                      A. All  requests  for features submitted  to  Technical 
                         Services  will  be  submitted  to  NTD  and  Product 
                         Marketing via the PIR process.
         
                      B. All  feature  patches  generated  by  the  Field  or 
                         Technical Services will be supported and  maintained 
                         by  Technical  Services  in  the  ALPHA  PATCH  FILE 
                         directory  until  NTD  accepts or rejects  the  PIR.  
                         Technical  Services will,  if possible,  obtain  PIR 
                         approval  from  NTD prior to  installing  a  feature 
                         patch into a network interface.
         
                      C. All   feature  patches  installed  into  a   network 
                         interface  which  do  not  have  NTD  approval  will 
                         require   a  letter  from  Sales  to  the   customer 
                         informing  them  of the special nature of the  patch 
                         and  its possible removal in the event of the  PIR's 
                         rejection.
         
                      D. All  feature  patches  must  be  tested  in  a   lab 
                         environment,   if   at   all  possible,   prior   to 
                         installation.
         
                      E. Upon acceptance of the PIR,  NTD will evaluated  the 
                         request  and  implement  the  feature  in  the  next 
                         possible release of source software,  as dictated by 
                         its priority, as set by the JPPC.  NTD may reject an 
                         associated  patch  that it feels is not  technically 
                         sound.     NTD's    primary   commitment   is    the 
                         implementation of features into the source code, not 
                         via patches.               
         
                      F. PIR's  and  feature patches rejected by NTD will  be

                         NTD  for resolution.   In the event that the PIR  is 
                         found unacceptable the customer will be notified via 
                         a  letter from Sales representative and the  feature 
                         patch will be de-installed.

             that the slot may process to the Supervisor in a minute.

             within the macro.  Only the neighbor node number is vital; all
             other parameters may be omitted, if left at default.
         
            [neighbor] the octal neighbor number the following definitions
                 are specified for.  If this neighbor never attaches 
                 to this node, the following values are never referred to.
                 All arguments after the node number may be left to default.
             [number of groups] the number of network channel groups (at 16
                 channels per group) this link will come up with (default is 8)
            ** This field is no longer used, but its place must be saved.
               Numbers in this field are ignored. **
             [windowsize] the network windowsize for the link, specified in
                 multiples of 4 to a maximum of 128 per link.  The default is 8
             [link type] SAT for satellite links; TER (default) for terrestrial
             [speed] the aggregate speed of all lines comprising the
                 link to the nearest defined value.  Valid values are:
         
                        2 2400 BPS         28 28.8 KBPS      MS >56 KBPS
                        4 4800 BPS         38 38.4 KBPS
                        9 9600 BPS         48 48 KBPS
                       19 19.2 KBPS        56 56 KBPS
          
                 If this parameter is not specified or is defined as 
              less than or equal to 28.8, the Node Code will calculate 
              the link speed dynamically.  If the speed is greater than
              28.8 and is defined by this statement, nodecode will use
              the defined rather than the calculated link speed.  Link
              speeds in excess of 56 KBPS are considered MS links.
         
                 It is recommended that the line speed on multi-line links
              be the same across each line.  

        Examples:

                        S.REF(a) identifies the sync port is defined for
                                this logical unit. Ports 0-15 are on the   
                                first sync card, 16-31 on the second.
         
                       M.REF(a,b) sets up SIO port assignment.  There are
                                2 arguments: (a) the motherboard number (0-3) 
                                and (b) the daughter card or interface card 
                                (PSM) port number (in Hex).
         
                        P.REF(a) sets up a high speed printer assignment:
                                the argument is the number of the printer
                                defined.
