  When is a node overloaded?
  --------------------------

  What does EXCT mean?

    The EXEC Loop count (EXCT) as displayed in the NS command in XRAY is
    the average number of EXEC loop iterations per second.  As with all
    statistics available through XRAY, this is the average per second
    value over a one-minute interval.

    The EXEC loop is one way of expressing one complete execution of all
    the Node Code processes.  Node Code functionality is performed by running
    various processes, such as the process that services lines, the process
    that disassembles the received packets, the process that reads data
    from the ISIS input/out rings, etc.  These processes are called from a
    'control' or 'dispatching' process which is known as the executive or
    EXEC; once all the processes on the EXEC's list have been run, the EXEC
    goes back to the beginning of the list and proceeds down the list of
    processes again (and again, and again....).  Each iteration is thus
    called an EXEC loop.

    In general, the number of EXEC loop counts (per second) will give an
    overall indication of the activity of the Node Code.  If a certain
    process takes up a lot of the CPU, then there will be fewer EXEC loop
    counts per second.  There are other processes that need to be run at a
    certain minimum interval, and if these processes are not serviced, then
    problems could result.  It is, HOWEVER, not a hard and fast rule that if
    the EXCT is low, e.g. less than 40, the node is overloaded.  The EXCT can
    range from 0 to any value - it all depends on the configuration of the
    node code slot.  If this value takes a momentary dip, but does not stay
    at a low value (less than 10) for a sustained period of time, there is
    no cause for alarm.


  ISIS Nodes

    In an ISIS node, the Node Code (slot 0), like all other slots, consists
    of foreground and background jobs.  The process which services network
    lines/links is a foreground job and is thus scheduled (by ISIS) to run
    every 25msec.  All other node code processes run in the background.  In
    this environment the EXCT only reflects the execution of the background
    processes of the node code slot; this does not represent the activity of
    the entire machine.


  Foreground and Background Overload

    One good mechanism to detect an overloaded node is from the Foreground
    and Background overload reports from the ISIS kernel.  The foreground
    report indicates that successive foreground executions are occurring
    without any intervening background execution; this means that the
    foreground is running late and background jobs do not have a chance to
    run.  The background report indicates that it is requiring more than 60
    fastc ticks (this is the recommended threshold) for a full cycle of
    background executions.

    As a rule of thumb, any foreground overload report is cause for concern.
    Some determination of the cause should be made.  If the overload is
    infrequent (i.e. one per hour) and there are no other symptoms such as
    long response times or inexplicable communications errors, then the
    machine should be considered as at maximum capacity and no increase in
    load should be planned.

    With the overload report there is a count of the number of times the
    overload occurred in the last four minutes.  If this number is large
    (say greater than 10) but the reports are infrequent, then there is some
    activity occurring with heavy peaks.  You should find out what is
    happening and evaluate it.

    Foreground overload is a kind of positive feedback system.  As an over-
    load occurs it is likely to cause another overload resulting in a rapid
    increase in the overload condition.

    Background overload is likely to be more forgiving.  The events in back-
    ground are not usually time critical.  As background load increases,
    response time will get worse.  This tends to cause a reduced load and
    hence is often self-limiting.  However judgement must be used to evaluate
    what is acceptable response time and how likely a buffer zap is to occur.
    No simple rule can be provided.


  Delays and Response Times

    Another indicator of load on the node code and on network links is the
    transit delays through the node code.  Depending on the line speeds of
    the network links, a total delay of under 100msec can be considered
    normal or acceptable.  A high code delay (greater than 50msec) may mean
    that the background process that disassembles and assembles packets is
    not running frequently enough.  High hardware delay values may indicate
    that the foreground process is overloaded, or may point to problems with
    window size, bandwidth limitations, or physical line problems.  Again,
    judgement must be used to determine if such delay values are cause for
    concern.


  A word of CAUTION

    The EXCT and the delay times should be treated as indicators that further
    monitoring and investigation may be necessary.  Much depends on the
    hardware configuration of the machine, the other slots that reside in the
    machine, the level of activity of the other slots and the swings in
    traffic distribution.

    It is also very important to remember that network performance or node
    performance cannot be defined in terms of absolute numbers.  Various
    parameters (e.g. response times, network delay, block transfer rates..)
    are used differently by users/customers to determine what is acceptable
    to them.  If a node is running with an EXCT of less than 20 consistently,
    but the users of the other slots in that node do not experience 'poor'
    performance and there are no other discernable problems, then the node
    is running at an acceptable level and should not be considered overloaded.

      Date : July 02, 1986




   Effective today, I am officially the TYMNET Marketing Product Manager
   for the ATC, this includes Public and Private (also Virtual Subnets)
   Networks.  I am the focal point at H.Q. for all ATC issues, questions
   and answers.

   This Ontyme is designed to bring everyone up-to-date on the status of
   the ATC.  Numerous meetings have been held involving NTD, HTS, QA, 
   MKTG and others to collect and validate the information contained in
   this update.  I would like to personally thank everyone envolved for
   their willing cooperation and dedication that assisted me in the
   collection of this information.

   NOW FOR THE NEWS!

   Due to the large number of variations of application environments and
   locations in which the ATC operates, it is necessary to retain the ATC
   in beta test status.  In order to get an accurate picture and  better
   control of the application and configuration of the ATCs, the following
   rules are applicable.
   
   ALL customers using the ATC product must be in compliance with beta test
   guidelines (*** BETA.TESTGUIDELINES).  This includes a signed beta test
   agreement (*** BETA.AGREE) to get support.  Further, all anticipated,
   pending, and backlog orders must be accompanied by signed beta test
   agreements and a completed Configuration / Application Questionaire
   (attached).  Each must be fully completed and sent to Headquarters to be
   considered for acceptance.  An acceptance or rejection response will be
   sent, after review, within 3 working days.  Acceptance notices will also
   be copied to the respective order administration personnel at
   Headquarters.  Rejection notices will state the reason and will not be
   considered candidates for ATCs.  It will be necessary to submit another
   order with an alternate equipment choice, at this time.
   
   Substitutions of Micro-Engines for ATCs will only be considered when a
   strong business case has been submitted and reviewed by H.Q.

   Customers having a problem with a currently installed ATC product should
   be instructed to follow the normal escalation procedures.  If a reported
   problem is determined to be able to be corrected by the new PROM version,
   the ATC will have the latest PROM version installed on site.  Please
   submit a completed Configuration and Application Questionaire with each
   escalation, it will really help determine the problem source.
   
   Problems which do not fall in to the above procedure will be addressed
   by either of the following two methods:
   
   1) If the ATC problem is a known, outstanding issue, not yet corrected
   by the new PROM version, a strong business case will be necessary for
   consideration of a temporary replacement with a Micro-Engine.  It might
   be better to slightly restrict the use of the ATC in the particular
   manner where the problem shows up and wait for the next PROM version 
   which will correct the problem.
   
   2) If the ATC problem is a new issue, HTS will investigate and attempt
   to duplicate it in the lab.  Depending on the outcome of the HTS
   testing, they will make a recommentation on what action should be taken.
   
   PIRs are NOT being accepted for modifications to the ATC.
   
   
   Please NOTE:
   This list supersedes all other documentation during the beta test.  Only
   after the completion of the beta tests will an updated list of
   limitations be released.  
   
   If you have any of the following configuration or application
   requirements, DO NOT submit beta test agreements, orders, or
   questionaires.  Requirements for any of the listed features means a
   different product is necessary to fulfil customer expectations.


  The ATC does NOT support:
   (Functionality that the ATC was not intended to support)
   1. Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC)
   2. Baudot, EBCDIC, or CORRESPONDENCE codes (not verified yet)
   3. Addressable ports
   4. Code downloading
   5. Dynamic network circuit REBUILD
   6. An Operations Monitor
   7. Multi-line links (Parallel network connections to the same neighbor
      node)
   8. Passthroughs (Network links supporting traffic destined for another
      node or other than origination and destination traffic just for the
      ATC)
   9. Cooling Fans
   10. Rack mounting option
   11. Network technologies other than Tymnet II (No X.25, Telenet etc.)

   For further details, see the PNETS directory on system 28.  The
   following files are available for other specific issues.

   ATC.REL         Internal overview, primarily Public Network
   ATCOMP.DOC      ATC description and comparison with Micro-Engine
   ATC.DOC         Installation and test instructions
   XRAY.ATC        ATC XRAY documentation
   TEATC.DOC       Text of the data sheet


   The ATC does have the following features:

   -Operates with a Tymnet network

   -Up to 8 asynchronous ports, 110-9600 bps (The quantity of ports
    supported is dependent on the aggregate total of the port speeds,
    async device types, application, total throughput, and number of network
    connections and speed) The ATC will work with asynchronous  ASCII
    terminals, but not P.C.s performing file transfers or devices operating
    in block mode at this time.
   
   -Up to 2 synchronous network ports, 2400 to 9600 bps Tymnet II, either
    sync or SIO links without the extended features i.e. Rebuild, Multi-line
    links, Passthroughs, Downline loading etc.
   
   -Modem control signals are available on asynchronous ports at 300, 1200,
    and 2400 bps dial-up applications

   -Designed to operate in a standard office environment without special
    conditioning, Temperatures from 50 to 122 degrees F, Relative Humidity
    from 10 to 90%, noncondensing, Altitudes from 0 to 10,000 feet.


   The ATC has had the following problems reported:
   
   1. Incorrect node number being reported
   2. Break key not being processed properly (causes unrecognizable
      characters)
   3. Not able to properly operate with a large number of inter-nodal hops
   4. Not recovering properly from power failures
   5. Excessive synchronous line retransmissions
   6. System halts when Command Circuit is cleared
   7. Not processing backspace key properly (half duplex mode only)
   8. Not able to recognize Terminal Identifiers (noisy async lines)
   9. Not able to recognize terminal speed (noisy async lines)
   10. Not able to process sustained asynchronous input without loss of
      data (Flow cintrol issues using block mode terminals and P.C. devices)

   Items 1 through 9 have been corrected.  Tests are being conducted to
   verify this.  All unprocessed ATC orders will include the latest PROMs.
   
   ATCs currently installed, potentially have all the above problems,
   however, some may have been field updated in the interim, correcting
   1,2,3, and possibly 4 only.
   
   In October, a beta test release is expected to correct ALL the problems
   (1 through 10).  This release, when proven acceptable, will then be
   applied to the units in the field.  This final release will not increase
   overall throughput or include any of the previously listed extended 
   Tymnet II features.
   
   The Configuration and Application Questionaire (attached) is required
   to be reviewed in headquarters before any ATC order will be considered 
   for processing.  In order to be in compliance, all information must be
   supplied and sent to:

   John Gomes        Q.A.    QSATS.J/GOMES
   Don Johnson       H.T.S   QSATS.D/JOHNSON
   Rourke McCusker   MKTG    NETS.R/MCCUSKER
   Dean Spieller     MKTG    NSMS.D/SPIELLER

   Remember to include a beta test agreement for each customer.  Any
   deviations from the initially supplied configuration information may
   possibly end up classifying that customer as unsupportable.  Please
   inform your customers so there won't be any suprises.

Written by : Bill Bartlett, O Marketing Support Mgr.
      Date : July 08, 1986




    Applied Communications Systems (ACS) is pleased to announce that
    version 22 of OnTyme will be deployed for customers beginning in
    August!  The following features and enhancements have been added.
 
    SUBJECT LINE.  On a :SEND or :REPLY the system will prompt for
    subject.  The subject text supplied by the sender will appear in
    the message header and all the message lists (:IN, :OUT, old,
    long, short, etc.).
 
    X.ONTYME.  This feature is an interface with which applications,
    PC "front ends", or intelligent terminal procedures may interact
    with OnTyme in a consistent, reliable, binary, machine-oriented
    format.
    
    PATHWAY.  This feature allows the user to log into any network
    host during an OnTyme session, capture data from the target host
    into the OnTyme workspace, transfer data between OnTyme and the
    network host, and execute commands on the host. The target host
    may reside in either the same network as OnTyme or in another
    network accessible through a gateway.
 
    XMODEM.  This feature is used for binary file transfer using the
    XMODEM protocol.
 
    SYSTEM GENERATED MESSAGES.  Version 22 of OnTyme will put a
    message in the :IN list of the sender regarding invalid recipients
    so they will no longer have to look through their :OUT (OLD) lists.
 
    RESERVED CHARACTERS. To facilitate future enhancements, six
    characters (!,@,#,$,%,&) will no longer be allowed in file names.
    These will be used later as 'wildcard' characters for displaying
    information with the :LIST command.
 
    :REPLY (cc)(msg#).  This command will send the contents of the
    workspace to the original recipients of msg#.
 
    COMMAND SCANNER. The OnTyme code has been improved and made more
    efficient.  Many system messages have been grammatically improved
    and made more consistent.
 
    Version 22 is available on the Marketing test host so that you can
    become familiar with the new product features. To request a
    temporary id on the test host, send a request to ACS.ONTYME.
 
    More complete documentation is being written and included in user
    manuals, technical manuals, and *** files in OnTyme as
    appropriate.  Definitions of the enhancements in version 22 of
    OnTyme may be found in the public file *** ONTYME.NEWS. Please
    distribute this announcement within your organization.  
 
 
    Version 22 WARNING!
    -------------------
    All 'intelligent front end' processes should be adequately tested
    for compatibility with version 22 of OnTyme before August 1.  
 
    ACS will provide technical assistance to complete this test.  To
    provide the longest possible lead time for any necessary code
    conversions, please schedule these tests as soon as possible.  Ids
    on the Marketing test host are now available upon request from
    ACS.ONTYME. Please keep ACS.ONTYME informed of the results.
 
    There are two enhancements in version 22 of OnTyme that have the
    POTENTIAL of disrupting 'intelligent front end' processes such as
    OnTyme :EXEC procedures, PC based packages, and intelligent
    terminal procedures that match on the text of OnTyme messages or
    the format of the :SEND, :REPLY, :IN and :OUT commands.  
    
    First, the text of many of the more obscure (not frequently
    encountered) system and error messages has been revised for
    grammatical improvement and consistencey. The most common messages
    such as ACCEPTED and ALL MESSAGES READ have not been changed.  You
    may obtain a list of the text changes by sending a request to
    ACS.ONTYME.  In the event that an incompatibility is found between
    a front-end process and version 22, ACS will urge that the
    X.ONTYME protocol be adopted in the front-end to preclude any
    future problems.  Use of X.ONTYME will fix the problem once and
    for all.  Please :READ *** ONTYME22.XONTYME for further
    information about this protocol.
    
    Second, each OnTyme session will default to having subject line
    enabled.  Each :SEND or :REPLY command will be followed by a
    prompt for subject.  The format of the :IN and :OUT lists will
    change to show a subject line for each message.  The subject line
    feature may be disabled at the session level providing a very
    simple solution to any compatibility problems caused by subject
    line.  Please :READ *** ONTYME22.SUBJLINE for further information
    about the subject line feature.
 
    Please direct any questions about this announcement to ACS.ONTYME.

RESPONSE:

           Regarding your questions about the various fields shown in
   the UTIL LUN display, I have discovered the following:

   1.  DDB - in version 1.02+ this is now called DSS or Default Sector
             Size.  I would assume that in this older version, DDB is
             perhaps Default Data Block size or something.

   2.  B/T - Blocks per Track.  Again in newer versions this is S/T or
             Sectors per Track.  Note that the values are in hex.

   3.  T/C - Tracks per Cylinder.

   4.  Status - The status field is divided into two bytes - the first
             8 bits refer to the status of the controller and the other
             8 are the status of the device.  To decifer the meaning of
             these bits, depending on the type of device you are using,
             check out the following manuals:

       MSC type drive - MSC-1400 High Density Disk Controller Operation
             and Maintenance Manual - sec.4.4.6.6 Status - pp.4-13 thru
             4-15 (0-7 for controller, 8-15 for drive)

       DK type drive - Disk Diagnostics Users Guide - SS bits on p.47
             for the controller - SS bits on p.49 for the drive.

       MT tape drive - Model TC-140 Tape Controller Hardware Manual - 
             pp.3-8.

      GUIDELINES USED FOR TERRESTRIAL AND SATELLITE LINKS' WINDOWSIZES
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      ----------------------------------------------------------------


Written by : Gail Bubsey, HQ Network Staff Consultant
      Date : June 30, 1986




ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   Are these any published guidelines on what window sizes should be estab-
   lished for different links? (ie, satellite links of different speeds, long
   haul liks of different speeds, [San Fran to London for example], and MS
   links.)

   If there are now published guidelines, the main concern is what window
   size 9.6 satellite links should be set for.



RESPONSE:

           Regarding this RFI, requesting the guidelines used for terrestrial
   and satellite links' windowsizes, the following is the result of a study
   done and has been included in the Planet program for windowsize estimation.

                       PROBLEM OF "RTS DROPS TOO SOON"
                       -------------------------------
                       -------------------------------


Written by : Ping Chu, HQ Network Staff Consultant
      Date : July 22, 1986




     The problem of "RTS DROPS TOO SOON" has appeared in several SDLC 
     Extension Cord customer sites. Please try to gen your RTSCTS
     statement to NO in your SDLC tymfile in order to avoid this problem.  
     
     Normally, if an SDLC link requires RTS/CTS handshaking, the Transmitter    
     ought to raise its RTS (Request To Send) signal to the Receiver. 
     When the Receiver is ready to turn the line around, it shall raise    
     its CTS (Clear To Send) to relinquish the control of SDLC link to the 
     Transmitter. During the transmission of entire SDLC frame, the   
     Transmitter has to energize its RTS signal and makes sure that the    
     RTS signal stays high until the Ending Flag of the Final SDLC frame   
     is transmitted.
     
     However, our SDLC slot code and the Z-80 Daughter Card drop the RTS   
     signal before transmitting the Ending Flag of the Final SDLC frame.   
     
     Dee Halbrook has issued a PIR to implement a new Z-80 Channel Command 
     Word.  Gary Stoy of Private Net Product Marketing also issued a PIR 
     for NTD, SDLC Development unit, to enhance the SDLC software to drop 
     the RTS signal in a more appropriate time. The SIO Microcode change in
     conjunction with the SDLC software change will fix this "RTS Drop
     Too Soon" problem.  
     
     We have no estimate as to the potential date of completion of this    
     combined task. But before the announcement of completion is made 
     available to you, please gen your RTSCTS to NO in your SDLC tymfile   
     to ignore the RTS/CTS handshaking.

     THE HOSTCOST MACRO PRESENTS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR LOAD-BALANCING
MULTI-TARGETED HOSTS IN X.25.  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS MACRO IS ALSO
A SOURCE OF MALEVOLENT AND EVIL PITFALLS FOR THE UNWARY.  ALONG ITS
PATHS REPOSE THE BONES OF MANY A LUCKLESS CC WHO EMBARKS ON ITS
TRAILS WITHOUT REALIZING THE HIDDEN DANGERS LURKING IN THE BORDERING
THICKETS.  THIS ARTICLE IS TO UNRAVEL SOME OF THIS MYSTERY.

     THE FOLLOWING POINTS SHOULD BE REMEMBERED:


   - ALL USERNAMES USED IN THE MULTI-TARGETING SCHEME MUST BE MULTI-TARGETED
     TO ALL HOSTS IN THE MULTI-TARGETING SCHEME.  THE ALERT READER WILL
     APPRECIATE THAT THROUGH TRICKERY YOU DON'T EVEN NEED THIS RESTRICTION.
     BUT, FOR THE GENERAL CASE, YOU WILL WANT TO DO THIS.

   - ALL HOSTS IN THE MULTI-TARGETING SCHEME MUST BE ON DIFFERENT NODES.

   - ALL NODES CORRESPONDING TO THE MULTITARGETED HOSTS MUST HAVE A POSITIVE
     NUMBER OF PASSTHRUS.  ZERO PASSTHRUS ON ANY NODE WILL CREATE LINK COSTS
     OF 2048 (SUPERVISOR'S APPROXIMATION TO INFINITY) ON ALL LINKS GOING TO
     THAT NODE, AND ALL HOSTCOST CONSIDERATIONS WILL BE OVERRIDDEN.  NO TRAF-
     FIC WILL GO THROUGH THE HOST ON A NODE WITH ZERO PASSTHRUS.

   - THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HOSTS THAT CAN EXIST IN A SINGLE MULTI-TARGETING
     SCHEME IS 6.


     REMEMBER THAT THE SUPERVISOR ROUTES CALLS BASED ON THE TOTAL COST OF
GOING TO EACH HOST.  THIS TOTAL COST CONSISTS OF THE HOST COST PLUS THE
NETWORK COST.  IF ONE HOST HAS A HIGHER HOST COST, BUT THE SECOND HOST
HAS A HIGHER NETWORK COST, CALLS MAY STILL GO TO THE HOST WITH THE HIGHER
HOST COST.  BECAUSE OF THIS, HOST COST INCREMENTS SHOULD BE CHOSEN AS
HIGH AS POSSIBLE.  USE THE FOLLOWING RULES FOR SETTING UP HOSTCOST
PARAMETERS IF YOUR NUMBER OF DPORTS IS A POWER OF 2:

   - CHOOSE MINIMUM COST TO ZERO
   - CHOOSE NUMBER OF STEPS EQUAL TO NUMBER OF DPORTS.
   - CHOOSE MAXIMUM COST EQUAL TO THE HIGHEST MULTIPLE OF YOUR DPORTS
     THAT DOES NOT EXCEED 255d.


EXAMPLES:

  64 PORTS :   HOSTCOST(0,192,64,0,64,64)
  32 PORTS :   HOSTCOST(0,224,32,0,32,32)
  16 PORTS :   HOSTCOST(0,240,16,0,16,16)


     IF YOUR NUMBER OF DPORTS IS NOT A POWER OF 2, THIS IS TRICKY.  YOU 
WILL GET A GEN ERROR IF YOU PICK NUMBER OF STEPS TO BE NOT A POWER OF
2.  YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES:

   - CALL J/LUCAS TO OBTAIN A PATCH THAT WILL HELP YOU OUT.
   - LOAD-LEVEL FOR THE HIGHEST POWER OF 2 LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO YOUR
     NUMBER OF PORTS, REALIZING THAT BEYOND THIS CALLS WILL BE ASSIGNED
     RANDOMLY.  EXAMPLES:


   24 PORTS :   HOSTCOST(0,240,24,8,16,16)
   45 PORTS :   HOSTCOST(0,224,45,13,32,32)

     IN THE FIRST EXAMPLE, CALLS WILL BE BALANCED UNTIL THERE ARE 16 USERS
(I.E. 8 PORTS AVAILABLE) AND THEN THE HOST COST WILL NO LONGER INCREMENT.
PARALLEL LOGIC FOR THE SECOND EXAMPLE.

     AN NSR IS CURRENTLY AT NTD TO REMOVE THE RESTRICTION THAT THE NUMBER OF
STEPS MUST BE A POWER OF 2.  I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS RESTRICTION WILL BE
ELIMINATED.


     ALSO REMEMBER THAT THE HOSTCOST IS REPORTED BY X25 TO THE SUPERVISOR
EVERY 15 SECONDS.  IF PEOPLE LOG ON RAPIDLY, A LARGE NUMBER OF LOGONS IN
ONE 15-SECOND INTERVAL WOULD ALL GO TO ONE HOST.  THE OTHER HOST WILL
CATCH UP ONCE THE LARGER HOST COST IS REPORTED BUT THOSE IN SEARCH OF
PERFECTION MAY WANT TO REPORT THE HOSTCOST MORE OFTEN.  THIS IS POSSIBLE,
BUT NOT ADVISABLE FOR EVERYONE.  THE SUP CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO HANDLE
HOSTCOST MESSAGES EVERY SECOND FOR EVERY HOST IN THE NETWORK.  BUT IF YOU
THINK YOU HAVE A SPECIAL CASE, YOU CAN TALK TO J/LUCAS ABOUT GETTING A
PATCH.

 Network Routing Problems
-------------------------

Of late, a number of response time and routing problems have occurred
- lines are becoming OV and response time is degrading - while there
are perfectly good paths being ignored.

To really understand the problem, an explanation of link costs is
called for.  Link cost is determined by the cumulative consideration
of 5 factors: links speed, 1-way overloading, 2-way overloading, IRC
penalties, and the type of link, TER/SAT vs. the type of traffic,
interactive/batch.

Each factor has a given value in hex.  These are added together to
obtain the link cost; the various link costs are then added to obtain
the cost of the circuit.

The cost values are as follows:

    Speed     Value          1-Way OV     2-Way OV
    ---------------          --------     --------
      4.8       17              18           30
      9.6       11
     14.4       10           Circuit      TER      SAT
     19.2       0F           -------------------------
       MS       0C           Batch         31        0
                             Interactive    0       31

Origin   Destination   Possible Path          Cost
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interactive Traffic
2010         2013      2010-2013              11           = 11 <-L.C.P
                       2010-2012-2013         10+31+0C     = 4D
                       2010-2011-2014-2013    11+10+0C     = 2D
             2014      2010-2011-2014         11+10        = 21
                       2010-2012-2014         10+31+0C     = 4D
                       2010-2013-2014         11+0C        = 1D <-L.C.P

So, note that all interactive traffic originating at 2010 and going to
either 2013 or 2014 will be routed over the same link between 2010 and
2013.  If the link from 2010 were to go overloaded in one direction,
then the following costs would go into play:

Origin   Destination   Possible Path          Cost
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interactive Traffic
2010         2013      2010-2013              11+18        = 29 <-L.C.P
                       2010-2012-2013         10+31+0C     = 4D
                       2010-2011-2014-2013    11+10+0C     = 2D
             2014      2010-2011-2014         11+10        = 21 <-L.C.P
                       2010-2012-2014         10+31+0C     = 4D
                       2010-2013-2014         11+0C+18     = 35

Under the one way overload, new traffic from 2010 to 2013 will 
continue to be routed over the same path, but traffic from 2010 to
2014 will move to the alternate 2010-2011-2014.

This type of experimentation can be done for all sorts of situations
and configurations and can help you to understand what is really going
on and why some of the problems that you are having may occur.
