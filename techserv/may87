        QUESTION

        1) Within the Sup. Gen. -
           The DEFACT macro is required to define the number of sectors allo-
           cated to the accounting file on disk (in sectors). 
           
        2) Within the RAM tymfile - 
           The MXBLK macro is to specify the max. block no. for non-specified 
           Sup.  The value of MXBLK is in blocks.


        Is there any relation between these two macros? If so,  converting from
        block to sectors or from sector to block for both macros above in order
        to have the corresponding values matched. is this correct?


        Please advise!






        RESPONSE


        The MXBLK value in blocks should be DEFACT's # of sectors divided by 4,
        +1.  So if  DEFACT has 3000 sectors,  MXBLK should equal 0C01.   If you
        have sups with different numbers  of accounting sectors, you can  set a
        seperate  MXBLK for  each,  I think  the  parameter in  RAM  is MXBLK1,


                                           1
        Relations between DEFACT Macro and MXBLK Macro           April 30, 1987


        MXBLK2, etc., but you could  contact the RAM people to make  sure.  Any
        sups  not  specified  in  RAM will  default  to  the  set  MXBLK value.
        Remember that  MXBLK is  only the  maximum block  number that  RAM will
        allow you to  set.  If you  have a smaller  number of sectors,  but are
        using the larger MXBLK value, simply do not set a value larger than the
        real number of (sectors/4)+1.

               2 -  Circuit Rebuild Requirements/Command Circuit Routing







        Written by : Sandra Nilluka
              Date : April 1, 1987







        Below is copy of a  techtip I published April, 1986  describing circuit
        rebuild  requirements and  related  topic of  command  circuit routing.
        Nodecode 5.21  does NOT  change requirements;  it corrects  the history
        buffer  handling  problems  that  caused  rebuildable  circuits  to not
        rebuild.



        CIRCUIT REBUILD

        Circuit rebuild is a feature that provides for broken  virtual circuits
        to be re-constructed by the  network, such that the user  experiences a
        delay  in service  during the  rebuild process,  but does  not  have to
        perform a login and loses no data.



        All  of  the following  conditions  must be  met  for a  circuit  to be
        successfully rebuilt:

        1. Origination and destination nodes must be nodecode version
           5.06 (or higher) with rebuild enabled, and all intermediate
           nodes in a circuit's path must be nodecode version 5.xx.
           This implies Solo and Isis; ATCs do not support rebuild.
           The orig. and dest. nodes will exchange control 
           information on data successfully received and maintain history
           buffers for re-transmission, should rebuild occur.

        2. There must be an alternate path available for construction
           of a replacement circuit path.  The link that went out will
           not be used in the new path.


                                           3
        Circuit Rebuild Requirements/Command Circuit Routing     April 30, 1987


        3. The circuit breakage must be caused by a network link outage
           or an intermediate node outage.  It can not be caused by a host
           crash, host link outage, host disconnect, user disconnect, or
           orig./dest. node crash.

        4. The command circuit of the destination node must be intact.
           If the circuit is down, the destination node does not exist,
           causing the rebuild request to be rejected.  Currently, the
           sup holds off rebuild requests for 8 seconds before checking.

        5. The command circuit of the origination node must be intact.
           If the circuit is down, the node will not request circuit rebuild
           because the node can not communicate with the supervisor.

        6. The sup can not be saturated with rebuild requests.  Once its
           limit is reached, the sup will reject rebuild requests.  The
           current public network limit is 512 outstanding requests.

        7. The origination and destination nodes must be able to ensure
           no loss of data.  If data cannot be provided from history
           buffers, or if the nodes can not agree on control sequence
           numbers, the now-rebuilt circuit is immediately zapped.


        The rebuild option requires  additional memory for the  circuit rebuild
        logic, and history buffers for each circuit originating  or terminating
        in the node.



        The  impact on  CPU  utilization is  not measured.   Data  for eligible
        circuits  must also  be  placed into  history buffers.   The  node must
        periodically report control information.  Circuit outage   would invoke
        the rebuild process.


        COMMAND CIRCUIT ROUTING


        A command  circuit is the  circuit over which  the node  and supervisor
        communicate.  Its path is determined by the supervisor:

        1. At takeover time when the sup gains control of the network.

        2. At re-take time following a command circuit outage.

        3. At re-take time per Probe command request.

        There is no provision for designated routing.  One can not define which
        of a node's links will be used for its command circuit.




                                           4
        Circuit Rebuild Requirements/Command Circuit Routing     April 30, 1987


        For a given node, one could force the command circuit to use a specific
        link, by disconnecting or shutting  all other links and then  issuing a
        re-take command.  If the disconnection caused the command circuit to be
        zapped, re-take  would automatically  occur.  Upon  re-take completion,
        the other links could be re-connected or unshut.



        However, a subsequent takeover by a new supervisor or a re-take  due to
        loss of command  circuit or Probe  command results in  command  circuit
        path re-calculation, and thus defeats the contrived path.

        1. I can give you some  idea about the algorithm. . . Let's  assume the
        PVCTIM is 5 minutes, which means  PBT will check if a circuit  needs to
        be rebuilt (ckt was  zapped by any reason)  or not every 5  minutes. If
        so, when the CKT  will be rebuilt depends  on the options and  the time
        (e.g. at the  first minute of  the 5 minutes or  at the 4th  minutes 30
        seconds of that 5 minutes)  the ckt gets zapped, in another  words, how
        much time left from the time ckt zapped to the time PBT to check if ckt
        still there.  Node load and configurations will affect the overall slot
        performance,but there are not concerns of PVC logic.


        2. MINXMT and MAXXMT  are two limits used by  PBT to see if  PBT should
        start  transmitting data  to CU  or not,  if EDF  is enabled.  When PBT
        receives data from Network before ETX arrives, MINXMT is limit  to tell
        PBT  do not  deliver data  to CU  yet no  matter what.  As soon  as the
        caculated number is over this  MINXMT, then PBT is allowed to  send out
        data ,as  to how they  caculate the number  is defined by  an algorithm
        (complicated) in code. But no  matter what the algorithm tells  you, if
        the caculated number is over MAXXMT, PBT just starts shipping data.


        3. BUFLET is  the macro to redefine  the number of Big  Bufferlet.  The
        basic formula to caculate proper number of bufferlet is

                    IF   NPORT-NDEVM
           NBBFLT   EQ   (NDEVM+NBILM*2)*MINBUF+BUFLO
                    ELSE
           NBBFLT   EQ   (NPORT+NBILIN*2)*MINBUF+BUFLO
                    EI
           NBBFLT   EQ   NBBFLT+80
         
           note:
           nport - number of ports
           ndevm - number of devices
           minbuf - 10x    :minimum buffers
           buflo  - 15d    :denger level of buffers
           nbilin,nbilm - number of lines


        4. Return code is  the mnemonic representation of response  received by
        PBH/PBT after they  send something to  Host/CU.  It is  used internally
        and will be translated to  meaningful message (e.g ACK0, ENQ  ...) when
        you enable protocol trace thru PBH BOM or PBT BOM.

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:



        Can  we support  'Transmission groups'  using our  SDLC  extension cord
        service.  The customer specifically  wants to have one of  the multiple
        lines  transit the  SDLC extension  cord service  and the  other  use a
        standard  modem-to-modem  connection.  If  there  is likely  to  be any
        problem with this, what could he expect.







        RESPONSE:



        SNA  transmission  groups are  composed  of one  (or  more)  SDLC links
        between adjacent PU.T4 nodes.  The links which make up the transmission
        group may have  different attributes, such  as mode (HDX/FDX)  or speed
        (BPS) .  Thus sequenced frames which pass over a transmission group may
        arrive at the  next node out of  order.  As such, a  transmission group
        sequence number is assigned within each SDLC frame and the  sequence is
        recreated at each node.


        Since this sequencing is provided in in the PATH CONTROL level of SNA ,

        our  SDLC  interface  cannot  handle  some  of  the  subtle  points  of
        transmission  groups   properly.   Of  special   concern  is   the  SNA
        'Transmission group sweep' procedure.

        FOR ANYONE NEEDING TO GEN CMT VERSION 3.00 -
         
                The latest patches released to Source make it necessary to
                be careful with the labels in your tymfile. Please do not use
                labels beginning with MENU or DSP anywhere (MENU, MENU1, DSP,
                DSP1, DSP135, etc.). Most tymfiles that use it have it in a 
                MENUSR macro, i.e., MENUSR(MENU), and its matching DEFMEN 
                macro, or in a DEFELE macro, i.e., DEFELE(DSP135,. . .). 
                If MENU or DSP is used as part of a label you may get a gen 
                error or you may get no gen error and have strange errors 
                and/or crashes when the code is loaded. As an alternative to
                re-writing your entire tymfile, you can look up any labels 
                you have questions about in the Cross Reference of a version 
                3.00 code listing. If you find it in the Cross Reference you 
                should not use it in your tymfile. As an example, DSP135 is 
                a label in the source code which you can find in the Cross 
                Reference, so you should not use it. DSP136, however is not 
                an existing label so it is all right to use it in your tymfile.

                  The  ATC's  with prom version 1.26  have been  running 
                  successfully   in   the   field   with no   technical 
                  escalations.  There have been no defects in the ATC's
                  which have gone through Staging since January 1987.
    
                  Effective immediately ATC's are no longer mandatory 
                  hardware staged by Network Systems Staging.   ATC's may 
                  be  staged  as  part  of a pilot network  order  or  by 
                  special   permission  of the  Network  Systems  Staging

        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        Customer is using EXECULINK software / terminal type, which  supports a
        25th status line.  25th status line works perfectly.  However,  since I
        have STATUS LINE turned on in code, all terminal types now  have status
        line, which erases data on 24th line.


        I know that all terminals have a keyboard sequence to erase  the status
        line, however...........


        Is there a way  to only turn on STATUS  LINE for one terminal  type and
        DEFAULT all the others to NO status line?????







        RESPONSE:


        The present CMT code allows you to turn the status line on and  off for
        all terminals, but you  can't turn it on  for some and not  for others.
        The user can, as you mentioned,  turn his status line off after  he has
        logged in, but that is about your only option.

        TTE is  pleased to announce  the schedule of  classes for the  3Q 1987.
        Please note that we have  scheduled classes to       be held  in Vienna
        VA.  The TTE 510 September 14-18 and TTE 520 September 21-October 2 are
        open to internal employees.  Even though these classes will be  held in
        Vienna,  they  will  be  taught  by  TTE  instructors  and   the  usual
        registration procedure should be used.


        We  have also  tried to  clear up  some confusion  in  the     hardware
        track.  Last quarter we added basic telephony and  satellite technology
        to the  basic introductory course-     formerly TTE 110  and renumbered
        the course TTE 310 Data  Communications Concepts.  We also added  a lab
        course called TTE  320 - Data  Communications Operations. Thus  TTE 110
        and  TTE 300  were eleminated.   Now  to make  what we  have  done even
        clearer we  are combining  the theory and  lab portions  into a  15 day
        course called TTE 310 - Data Communications Concepts and Operations.


        Simiarly we have combined the Engine Maintenance course TTE 330 and the
        Hardware  Troubleshooting course  TTE  340 into  one course  TTE  330 -
        Tymnet Hardware Maintenance and  Troubleshooting.

        the  process  of being  modified  to accept  registration  for  the 3Q.

        Determine Usage of An Async Outdial Host                 April 30, 1987






                    10 -  Determine Usage of An Async Outdial Host







        Original Question by : Chris Chung, Communications Specialist
                 Response by : John Reilly, HQ Network Staff Consultant
                        Date : April 24, 1987







        ORIGINAL QUESTION:


        WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO  DETERMINE THE USAGE OF AN ASYNC  OUTDIAL HOST?
        WHEN  I LOGGEN  INTO DDT  AND TRIED  TO CHECK  THE USAGE  OF  THE ASYNC
        OUTDIAL HOST (NODE 2035 HOST # 2262), I GOT THAT THERE WERE 6 PORTS AND
        21 PORTS IN USE. WHAT DOES IT MEAN?







        RESPONSE:


        1. The  best way  to determine usage  on an  outdial rotary  is through
        CONSAT extended  DDT. When  issuing the  'port' command,  physical port
        numbers suffixed with  a 'C' in the  'port' field are ports  which have
        successful outdial calls placed.


        2. When you logged into DDT you saw 'host 2262 has 6 ports, 21 ports in
        use', the 6 refers to the number of command ports con-figured using the
        CONSAT 'OUTHOST' macro. This is the maximum number of users who  can be
        in command mode at one time.  This does NOT affect the number  of users
        who can place outdial calls.  Command mode is the time  between logging
        onto the outdial host and placing a successful outdial call.  The 21 is
        the total  number of  ports in use  (outdial calls  + incoming  calls +
        command ports).

        Determine Usage of An Async Outdial Host                 April 30, 1987


        3. Additionally, a port which is in command mode will appear  above the
        physical  range of  async ports  when issuing  the 'port'  command. For
        example, if you have 16 async ports assigned (log-ical 0-15), the first
        command  port  will  appear  as 16  in  the  'port'  field,  the second
        simultaneous command port will appear as 17, etc.
