      Many of you have been asking, "How many devices can one SNA/CMT be
   genned for, before more SNA/CMT slots and a Network Connection need to be
   ordered?"
 
      The answer is; SNA/CMT can support approximately 45 devices.  That's 23 
   simultaneous users, with CRT's and Printers and 19 terminal types, or 45 
   simultaneous CRT's and 19 terminal types.  (Note:  23 users, with printers,
   will give a very slow response time in most applications.  45 simultaneous
   users will exceed the capacity of even a 14.4 line in most applications.) 

      The memory capacity of the engine is fully utilized with these configur-
   ations.  This means you will need to order another SNA/CMT and Network
   Connection if you need more device addresses.  This question will come up 
   if:

   a. one-to-one addressing is being used for either security or printer 
      support.
   b. wild card addressing is being used for CRT's only, and the number of 
      simultaneous users the customer expects in the "busy hour" exceeds the 
      capacity of the Network Connection.
 
      What if your customer has more simultaneous users, fewer terminal types
   or requires more device addresses?
 
   1. The Field CC will need to figure out what you can support in one
      Engine.  (In order to help you, guidelines have been prepared and are
      available in Ontyme *** SNA/CMT.SIZE.  These guidelines contain infor-
      mation collected from NTD, Tech Svcs, and Management Sciences and 
      contain the necessary formulas to model memory size.  Once a configur-
      ation has been modeled, then the CC should gen it to make sure each 
      SNA/CMT/NetConnection will fit in the memory of 1 Engine.  If it fits in
      1 Engine, you can then submit your order.
 
   2. At the present time, a special configuration with special pricing, is 
      available for SNA/CMT that will support approximately 75 to 86 devices.
      CAUTION!!, If 86 devices are genned, then the engine is fully utilized 
      and there is no room for upgrades, patches, etc.  Once again it is a 
      good idea to have your CC gen this to make sure your SNA configuration 
      will fit on 1 Engine.  If you need this special arrangement you should
      contact Product Marketing for pricing information before you quote 
      prices to your customers.  This configuration consists of a mini-Engine 
      for SNA, and a Micro hardwired to the mini for the CMT.
 
   What other alternatives do you have?
 
   1. Consider using Bisync.  At the present time, all IMS shops must use this
      option if they require printers.  Additionaly, 1 slot can support 255 
      device addresses and the CMT will comfortably allow as many simultaneous
      users as the Network Connection will allow.  All this will fit in 1 
      Engine's memory.
 
   How many simultaneous users will a Network Connection support?
 
      This is very dependent upon the customers application.  Experience has 
   shown that the number of simultaneous users can vary from as few as 10 to 
   as many as 25 before response time is impacted.
 
   What's going to be available in the future?

      CRM4 will be ready for beta test this year.  Bisync will be ready in 
   3Q86 and SNA in 4Q86.  This will allow wild card addressing to be used for
   CRT and Printer pairing.  This will help because the HIF slot will only 
   need to be genned for the number of simultaneous users expected.  
   (Reminder:  The Network Connection(s) has to be considered first to make
   sure it will handle the expected traffic in the busiest hour.)

   WARNING - TII V5.11

      When using the Xray "DB" command, DO NOT use more than five (5) nodes 
   in the node list.


      For the following versions of nodecode, the Xray "DB" command (with a 
   node list exceeding five (5) nodes) will crash the node in which Xray is 
   running:
   
                          20511 - Solo Consat
                          00511 - Solo Switcher
                          10511 - Isis Nodecode



      This problem will be fixed in the next betatest release of nodecode 
   version 5.11.

Written by : Steve White, Field Communication's Consultant
             ** Originally written as a response to a customer's enquiry **




      THANK YOU FOR YOU ENQUIRY REGARDING THE PASSWORD SECURITY, OFFERED BY 
   TYMNET.  IN REPLY TO YOUR TELEX, I SHALL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS IN THE ORDER
   IN WHICH YOU GAVE THEM, BUT FIRST, SOME GENERAL INFORMATION:


      TYMNET USES USERNAMES/PASSWORDS TO CONTROL THREE SECURITY ORIENTED 
   FUNCTIONS:

   a) IS THIS USER AN AUTHORISED USER?
   b) IS THIS USER ALLOWED TO ORIGINATE A CALL FROM THIS POSITION IN THE 
      NETWORK?
   c) IS THIS USER ALLOWED TO PLACE A CALL TO THE REQUESTED DESTINATION?

      FUNCTION (a), IS ACHIEVED BY THE NETWORK SUPERVISOR (CENTRAL ROUTING
   COMPUTER), WHICH CHECKS THAT THE USERNAME IS PRESENT ON IT'S MASTER USER
   DIRECTORY (MUD) AND THAT THE PASSWORD GIVEN, MATCHES.  (NOTE: THE PASSWORD
   IS SCRAMBLED AND IS NOT KEPT ANYWHERE, BY THE NETWORK, IN ITS NATIVE FORM.)
   THERE ARE FIVE NETWORK SUPERVISORS (ON PUBLIC TYMNET).  EACH HAS ITS OWN 
   MUD WHICH IS UPDATED FROM A SINGLE CONTROLLING USER DIRECTORY (CUD).  ONLY
   ONE SUPERVISOR IS ACTIVE CONTROLLING THE NETWORK AT ANY GIVEN TIME.  THE 
   OTHERS ARE ON HOT STANDBY.

      FUNCTIONS (b) AND (c) ARE ACHIEVED BY DEFINING CLASSES AND GROUPS.  A
   CLASS OR GROUP CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF NODES (SWITCHES) AND/OR HOSTS.

   CLASS = A SET OF ORIGINATION POINTS IN THE NETWORK.
   GROUP = A SET OF DESTINATION POINTS IN THE NETWORK.

      EACH USERNAME HAS AN ASSOCIATED PROFILE (KEPT ON THE CUD AND MUD) SET AT
   THE TIME IT IS ISSUED AND CHANGABLE ONLY BY VALIDATION'S PERSONNEL.  THE
   CLASSES IN THE PROFILE DEFINE 'WHERE', ON TYMNET, THIS USERNAME MAY ENTER
   THE NETWORK AND A LIST OF HOSTS OR GROUPS, IN THE PROFILE, DEFINE WHERE THE
   USERNAME MAY PLACE A CALL TO.


   CALL ORIGINATION POINT CHECK - FUNCTION(b)
   ------------------------------------------

   THE SUPERVISOR CHECKS THAT THE LOCATION, FROM WHICH A USERNAME IS LOGGING
   INTO THE NETWORK, APPEARS IN AT LEAST ONE CLASS IN THE USERNAME'S PROFILE.
   IF THE USERNAME IS VALID, BUT THE USER'S PROFILE DOES NOT ALLOW ACCESS FROM
   THIS LOCATION, THEN THE MESSAGE "ACCESS NOT PERMITTED" IS ISSUED AND THE
   USER IS INVITED TO "PLEASE LOG IN:  ".

   CALL DESTINATION CHECK - FUNCTION (c)
   -------------------------------------

   THE DESTINATION OF THE CALL MAY BE DETERMINED COMPLETELY BY THE PROFILE OF
   THE USERNAME, IN WHICH CASE THE CALL GETS ROUTED TO ONE OF A LIST OF HOSTS
   IN THE PROFILE.  WHICH HOST RECEIVES THE CALL, IS DETERMINED BY A SET OF
   PRIORITIES AND/OR THE LEAST "COST" ROUTE TO A HOST IN THE SET OF
   ALTERNATIVES.  COST IS NOT A MONETARY VALUE; IT IS A COMPLEX CALCULATION
   BASED ON NETWORK RESOURCE UTILIZATION AT THE TIME OF THE CALL.

   THE USER MAY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO SPECIFY A DESIRED DESTINATION:  SEE THE
   DESCRIPTION OF <HOST NAME FIELD> BELOW.  WITH THIS CAPABILITY, THE
   SUPERVISOR CHECKS THAT THE REQUESTED DESTINATION IS LISTED IN THE USERNAME
   PROFILE.  IF THE REQUESTED DESTINATION IS NOT FOUND IN THE PROFILE THEN A
   MESSAGE "ACCESS BARRED" IS GIVEN TO THE USER AND THEN AN INVITATION TO
   "PLEASE LOG IN:"  IS GIVEN.  A USERNAME ALWAYS HAS A DEFAULT DESTINATION SO
   THAT IF THE USER MAKES NO SELECTION THEN ONE IS MADE BASED ON THE USERNAME
   PROFILE.

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   NOW, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS EACH IN TURN....

   1) A USERNAME ON TYMNET MAY CONSIST OF THE CHARACTERS :
      A-Z, a-z, 0-9, dash (-), slash (/), period (.), comma (,) and the 
      asterisk (*).

   note: usernames that are purely numeric, may only be issued by TYMNET
         validations personnel and are reserved for TYMNET's implementation
         of X.121.

      A PASSWORD ON TYMNET MAY CONSIST OF CHARACTERS:
      A-Z, a-z, 0-9, space, dash, slash, period, comma, asterisk, hash (#), 
      dollar ($) and ampersand (&).  Alpha-Control characters may be used 
      also, but PAD users should be careful to AVOID the PAD RECALL character
      (CTRL-P is commonly used for PAD recall) and the user-data separator 
      (often a comma). 

   2) THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF A USERNAME ON PUBLIC TYMNET IS 12 CHARS.  (TRUNC-
      ATION IS AUTOMATIC WITHOUT A MESSAGE.)
      THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF A PASSWORD ON PUBLIC TYMNET IS 30 CHARS.
      THE MINIMUM LENGTH OF A PASSWORD IS THE NULL PASSWORD (CARRIAGE RETURN).

      TYMNET RECOMMENDS PASSWORDS BE AT LEAST 7 CHARACTERS LONG TO GIVE
      ADEQUATE SECURITY.  WE ALSO ADVISE THAT THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST ONE 
      NON-ALPHA CHARACTER.
   
   NOTE: THESE RESTRICTIONS DO NOT APPLY TO PRIVATE NETWORKS, BASED ON TYMNET
   TECHNOLOGY.

   3) AN ALGORITHM IS USED TO DETERMINE THE TIME AND THE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS 
      A USER MAY HAVE TO ENTER THE CORRECT USERNAME/PASSWORD COMBINATION.  
      EACH FAILED ATTEMPT TO ENTER A USERNAME OR PASSWORD, ADDS TO A 'PENALTY
      SCORE'.  IF THE PENALTY SCORE EXCEEDS A PRESET VALUE, THE FOLLOWING 
      MESSAGE IS ISSUED AND THE CALL CLEARED.  SIGNALS TO THE MODEM ARE 
      DROPPED SO THE USER MUST RE-DIAL TO TRY AGAIN.
  
      "PLEASE SEE YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE LOGGING IN"

      THE ALGORITHM ALLOWS FOR 3 ATTEMPTS TO ENTER THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD,
      ANY COMBINATION OF THREE ATTEMPTS IS ALLOWED.  FOR EXAMPLE:  IF THE USER
      ENTERS HIS USERNAME 2 TIMES INCORRECTLY AND THEN GETS IT CORRECT ON THE
      THIRD ATTEMPT, HE HAS ONLY ONE ATTEMPT TO GET THE PASSWORD ENTERED 
      CORRECTLY.

      ENTERING <ESCAPE>, AT ANYTIME DURING LOG-IN, ABORTS THE LOG-IN AND 
      CAUSES THE "PLEASE LOG IN: " PROMPT TO BE RE-ISSUED.  <ESCAPE> DOES ADD
      TO THE 'PENALTY SCORE' THUS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS THE USER MAY
      MAKE TO ENTER THE CORRECT USERNAME AND PASSWORD.

   EXAMPLE:  IF THE USER USED 3 <ESCAPES>'S, THEN TWO ATTEMPTS AT THE
             USERNAME/PASSWORD WOULD THEN BE ALLOWED.
   
      THE TIMEOUT LIMIT IS 2 MINUTES FOR NO ACTIVITY.  THERE IS NO PENALTY 
      APPLIED TO THE USERNAME SO THE USER MAY IMMEDIATELY RE-DIAL AND PLACE 
      FURTHER CALL ATTEMPTS.  A LOG IS KEPT OF FAILED CALL ATTEMPTS BY THE 
      NETWORK SUPERVISOR.  THIS LOG IS EXAMINED BY NETWORK SECURITY PERSONNEL.

   4) I AM NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE REFERRRING TO, WHEN ASKING
      ABOUT DOUBLE PASSWORDS.  HERE ARE SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES:

      AT THE PLEASE LOG IN PROMPT, A USER MAY ENTER :
      <USERNAME>:<HOST NAME FIELD>;<PASSWORD>

      THE <HOST NAME FIELD> AND <PASSWORD> ARE OPTIONAL.  TYPICALLY, A USER
      ENTERS JUST THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD.  THE USER'S CALL IS ROUTED BASED
      ON THE PROFILE OF THE USERNAME.  THE USERNAME MAY BE MULTI-TARGETTED, 
      PRIORITY TARGETTED, OR MULTI/PRIORITY TARGETTED TO A GROUP OF HOSTS ON 
      WHICH THIS USER IS ALLOWED ACCESS.


   THE FOUR DISTINCT USES FOR THE HOST NAME FIELD ARE AS FOLLOWS....
   
   SIMPLE USE OF THE <HOST NAME FIELD>
   -----------------------------------

   BY PLACING A TYMNET HOST NUMBER IN THE FIELD AFTER THE COLON(:), THE USER
   MAY BE ABLE TO DIRECT HIS CALL TO A PARTICULAR HOST, OUT OF THE SET OF 
   HOSTS TO WHICH HIS USERNAME ALLOWS HIM TO GO.  SUCH A USERNAME IS SAID TO 
   HAVE THE 'COLON OPTION'.  MANY, PERHAPS MOST, USERNAMES ARE SET-UP TO 
   IGNORE THE COLON OPTION IN WHICH CASE DATA IN THE <HOST NAME FIELD> IS 
   IGNORED BY THE SUPERVISOR DURING ROUTING AND THE CALL IS ROUTED (IF THE 
   USERNAME/PASSWORD IS VALID) ACCORDING TO THE USERNAME PROFILE.

   SUB-HOST ADDRESSING (:HHHHH.SSSS)
   ---------------------------------

   IF THE USERNAME HAS THE CAPABILITY TO SELECT A DESTINATION FROM IT'S
   PROFILE, THEN IT ALSO MAY SPECIFY A SUB-HOST ADDRESS.  THIS IS DONE BY
   INSERTING A PERIOD (.)  IN THE <HOST NAME FIELD>.

   FOR EXAMPLE:  
                    PLEASE LOG IN: <USERNAME>:.02;<PASSWORD>

   REQUESTS THE CALL BE ROUTED TO THE DEFAULT HOST FOR <USERNAME> AND SELECTS
   SUB-HOST 02.  A HOST COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED BEFORE THE PERIOD.  
   FOUR DIGITS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE SUB-HOST.

   TARGET PROFILES
   ---------------

   THE <HOST NAME FIELD> MAY ALSO BE USED FOR 'OUTBOUND' USERS (PLACING CALLS
   TO OTHER NETS) TO ENTER THE DNIC OF THEIR DESTINATION AND OPTIONALLY THE 
   TNIC OF THE INTERNATIONAL RECORD CARRIER THEY WISH TO USE.  FOR EXAMPLE 
   USERNAME 'T.OUTGOING' MAY BE SET UP TO ALLOW THE USER TO ENTER....

   T.OUTGOING:G4408T3119;<PASSWORD>

   IF THIS USERNAME/PASSWORD IS CORRECT, THEN THE CALL GETS SET-UP TO GO TO
   JAPAN VIA TRT TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND THE USER IS PROMPTED TO ENTER THE REST
   OF THE X.121 ADDRESS.  THIS USE OF THE <HOST NAME FIELD>, WE CALL 'TARGET 
   PROFILES'.
    
   NOTE: This is a relatively new feature and is not the way all 'outbound'
         calls are placed.

   HOST NAMES
   ---------- 

   THE FOURTH USE FOR THE <HOST NAME FIELD> IS CALLED 'HOST NAMES' AND IT MAY
   WELL BE THAT THIS IS THE FEATURE ABOUT WHICH YOU WERE ENQUIRING.

   THIS FEATURE IS DUE FOR RELEASE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 1987.  IT WILL 
   ENABLE THE USER TO ENTER AN ALPHA-NUMERIC NAME IN THE FIELD AFTER THE
   COLON - A HOST NAME.  THIS WILL BE A TYPE OF USERNAME, ASSOCIATED WITH THE
   USERNAME BEFORE THE COLON, POSSIBLY REQUIRING A SECOND PASSWORD.  THE HOST
   NAME IS USED TO ROUTE THE CALL IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USERNAME AND ALLOWS 
   THE USER TO USE MORE NATURAL LANGUAGE TO LOG IN.  THE USAGE EXAMPLE THAT 
   FOLLOWS IS, I HOPE, SELF EXPLANATORY AND ILLUSTRATES HOW FRIENDLY SUCH A 
   SYSTEM WILL BE TO USE.

   PLEASE LOG IN : BIG-COMPANY:JAPAN-HQ;<PASSWORD1>;<PASSWORD2>

   PLEASE LOG IN : BIG-COMPANY:USA-HQ;<PASSWORD1>;<PASSWORD2>

   NOTE: THE PASSWORDS ARE OPTIONAL

   THERE ARE SO MANY POSSIBILITIES FOR THIS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO GO INTO 
   THEM HERE AND SINCE THIS FEATURE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT IT IS NOT 
   APPROPRIATE TO TRY AND GIVE DETAILS WHICH MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.


   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


      TYMNET'S X.121 ADDRESSING SCHEME ALSO HAS SEVERAL SECURITY FEATURES
   MANY OF WHICH, WE BELIEVE, ARE UNIQUE TO TYMNET.

      VERY BRIEFLY, THERE ARE 4 POSSIBILITIES FOR A TYMNET HOST AS FAR AS 
   EXTERNAL NETWORK ACCESS IS CONCERNED:

   1) ACCESS FROM GATEWAYS NOT ALLOWED.
   2) ACCESS FROM GATEWAYH FULL X.121 ADDRESS AND PASSWORD REQUIRED 
      BEFORE THE CIRCUIT IS BUILT.
   3) ACCESS FROM GATEWAYS WITH ABBREVIATED X.121 ADDR "31069" WHICH CAUSES 
      THE TYMNET SUPERVISOR TO REQUEST A VALID USERNAME/PASSWORD BEFORE
      CIRCUIT IS BUILT.
   4) ACCESS WITH A FULL X.121 ADDR (SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FORMAT) WITH NO
      NETWORK SECURITY REQUIREMENT TO FULFILL BEFORE THE CIRCUIT IS BUILT.

      THE X.121 ADDRESSING SCHEME TYMNET EMPLOYS ALSO ALLOWS FOR ONE ADDRESS 
   TO BE PRIORITY-TARGETTED, MULTI-TARGETTED OR MULTI/PRIORITY TARGETTED TO A
   SET OF HOSTS.  THIS ALLOWS A SINGLE ADDRESS TO BE USED TO DIRECT A CALL TO
   ONE OF A SET OF PRIMARY HOSTS (CHOSEN BY THE LEAST COST PATH THROUGH THE 
   NET) OR IF NONE OF THE FIRST PRIORITY HOSTS ARE AVAILABLE TO GO TO ONE OF 
   A SET OF SECOND PRIORITY HOSTS (CHOSEN BY LEAST COST) AND SO ON.

      WE HAVE FOUND THE SCHEME IS FLEXIBLE TO CUSTOMER'S NEEDS AND HAS THE 
   POWER TO CONTROL ACCESS FROM FOREIGN NETS TO AN EXACTING DEGREE.

      NATURALLY, TYMNET CANNOT GUARD AGAINST THE NEGLIGENT USE OF USERNAME/
   PASSWORDS BY THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS, HOWEVER PASSWORD CHANGES CAN BE 
   EFFECTED IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES FOR USERNAMES WHOSE PASSWORDS HAVE BEEN 
   COMPROMISED.

      TMCS version 10.00 has just been released to the BASELINE by NTD. 
   There are two major functions introduced in version 10.00 - RELOAD and 
   ALARM which would require either a specially configured s/w environment, or
   that of h/w.  Please read the following, carefully, if you are a technical
   support person, otherwise you may skip the middle section and jump to the
   CONCLUSION.



      In order to facilitate the RELOAD functions in TMCS version 10.00, a
   special software configuration will be required.  The basics of this s/w 
   environment consists of the following elements:

         ISIS     version 5.08 or up             5.08 is in full release

    Node Code     version 5.10                   5.10 is in betatest

     Sup Code     version 41.02 or up            41.02 is in betatest

          ELF     version 3.10 or up             3.10 is in full release

     
      However, we recommend a modified list of the above configuration, due
   to the comlicacy involved in the support of multi-version and multi-release
   for the products, especially the Node Code and Sup Code.

      Let me first brief you on the status of existing betatest versions
   of N.C. and Sup Code:



   Node Code    Special features             Currently in   Target date of

                         tingent upon the availability of an additional
                         betatest site preferably a private net.

   ========================================================================






   CONCLUSION
   ----------

      TMCS version 10.00, without the RELOAD/ALARM, is considered to be in
   full release and compatible with the full release version of ISIS(5.08), 
   Node Code(5.06), Sup(41.01) and ELF(3.10).

      TMCS version 10.00, WITH the RELOAD/ALARM, is pulled back to the beta-
   test status and requires the following s/w configuration recommended by 
   Hqtech with consent of HQQA and NTD:

          ISIS      version 5.08                 full release

     Node Code      version 5.10                 betatest

      Sup Code      version 41.04                betatest

           ELF      version 4.00                 betatest

        CONSAT      version 3.07                 full release  (for ALARM)


      Therefore, to install TMCS 10.00 with the RELOAD/ALARM, the standard 
   procedures for acquiring the usage of betatest products must be followed 
   through Marketing and HQQA.

 

   DOCUMENTATION
   --------------

      The Reference Manual, for version 10.00, is to be ready for the final
   review.  This cycle will take anywhere from one week to a month or so.
   After the feekback is collected, it has to go through the preparation of
   production and then will be sent to the Printer.  We understand the 
   inconvenience this may have caused you and the customers, as it has on us,
   but please be patient while the Documentation group is trying its best to
   work out the schedule.  In the interim, make use of the Baseline documents
   and any Techtips coming your way, and of course, we are always here to
   answer any questions and provide you with assistance.

                      TECHALERT -- TAPE DRIVE PROBLEMS
                      --------------------------------
                      --------------------------------


Written by : Shirley Chiang, HQ Mgr. Application's Support
      Date : April 15, 1986




      During the past two months, a few incidents have occurred and esca-
   lated to us, in regard to the tape problems when running RAM (Raw Account-
   ing Merger) version 10.05 or 10.07.  It took us an extroadinary amount of
   time and effort to find that some of these were hardware related faults and
   actually should have been checked out upon installation; in particular, 
   problems such as tape running off the reel, drive intermittenly going off-
   line, or data density errors.

      These problems are not necessarily associated with RAM, but since RAM is
   the one application that makes the most use of the tape unit as its primary
   data storage medium, these symptoms tend to be mostly seen along with this
   product.

       To avoid any waste of time in the future, should similar situations
   occur in your support area, I'd like to share our experiences and strongly
   recommend that you read the followings carefully.  After reading my memo, 
   you may even want to walk up to the tape drive nearby and check the 
   installation as preventive action.

      Currently there are two types of tape drives - Kennedy 9000 and 9100,
   supported by Tymnet Engines.  They interface with the Engines through
   TC-140 tape controller, manufactured by Western Peripherals.  The tape
   driver routine, in ISIS, does not distinguish between these different
   models as they are made compatible at the controller level.  In other 
   words, it is transparent to the operating system and application software.

      The way ISIS retrieves the device status is by issuing the SSR command
   to sense the standard or normal status which includes eight bits for error,
   e-o-f, e-o-t or b-o-t, no motion, busy, examine, end-of-medium and device 
   unavialable.  If the Extended Status is desired, an additional OC (output 
   Command) instruction, with a hex value of 33, must be executed prior to the
   SSR command.  The Extended status also has eight bits for parity error, 
   timing error, rewinding, illegal command, high density, file protected, 
   b-o-t and 9-track.

      However, in the current versions of ISIS, the Extended status has always
   been sensed before the normal status, which is not recommended by Interdata
   and is different from the way the stand-alone tape diagonostics handle it,
   although so far we have not had sufficient evidence to prove it a problem.

      At any rate, there is somthing in the h/w setup you want to pay special
   attention to, as it will definitely affect the tape operations:


   1.  Speed chip on the tape controller board

       -  Use the chip of part number 120023-5 (or 01200237-5) for 75 IPS
          on Kennedy 9100 drives been widely installed for almost all of
          our applications using the tape unit, such as RAM, Netval, TMCS
          and Network Console.
 
          [note: chip part number 120023-4 (or 01200237-4) is for 45 IPS
          on Kennedy 9000.]

       -  This chip locates at A24 on the tape controller board and the part
          number is on the bottom of the chip.

   Symptom if incorrect chip is mounted:

       -  Causing data errors at 1600 density.


   2.  Address switch on the tape drive

       -  Be sure the seating and wire connection are secured.

   Symptom if switch is not seated properly or the wire connection is loose:
  
       -  Causing the device to go off-line intermittenly.


   3.  The miniature dip switch on the Tape Control Adapter paddle board
       (plugged to the back of the tape drive)

       -  This set of Congfiguration Switches includes 8 switches and must
          be set as follows:

          S1    S2    S3    S4    S5    S6    S7    S8
          off   on    off   off   off   off   on    off
                ---                           ---

       -  Switch #2 and #7 MUST BE SET ON for Kennedy drives.

       -  On top of other functions, Switch #2 actually governs the signaling
          of end-of-tape and the transfer of this signal to the controller
          so the s/w can recognize the e-o-t.

          [note: reference page 2-10 and 2-15 of "Model TC-140/148 Tape
          Controller Hardware Manual", published by Western Peripherals
          on March, 1978.]

    Symptom if swich #2 is set off:

       -  Causing the controller not able to sense the e-o-t and conse-
          quently the applications s/w to continue writing to the tape
          and eventually the tape going off the reel.


      If you encounter the above described symptoms and still fail to correct
   the problems with our suggested methods, please let us know immediately.

      Thanks to Richard Ho, of NTS, for providing the specific h/w informa-
   tion.

                            PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT
                         TYMNET-TELEX TRUNK GATEWAY
                         --------------------------
                         --------------------------


      Date : April 16, 1986




    Integrated Communications Applications is pleased to announce the
    Tymnet-to-Telex Gateway using Telex Trunk Signalling.  The Gateway
    permits Telex subscribers to reach a Telex center through Tymnet,
    instead of dedicating a leased line to their Telex machine.  The
    Gateway further permits owners of IBM PC's to subscribe to Telex;
    with our PC Message Handler software, FMH, the PC receives Telex
    messages in real time in the background, while the user runs normal
    PC applications.
 
    This interface provides direct Telex connection, rather than store-
    and-forward service.  It permits conversational Telex, where the
    parties alternately type questions and answers to each other.
 
    Customers who connect to the Gateway with more than one terminal,
    can pool their terminals, to receive each message on any available
    terminal.  Combinations of PC's and Telex machines can be grouped.
 
    The Gateway currently communicates with FTCC's Telex center using
    a form of the common trunk signalling used by the various Telex
    companies to interconnect with each other.  The Gateway software is
    flexible and easily adjusted for hookup to any Telex company.
 
 
Hooking up Subscribers
 
    A subscriber using a Telex machine must be hooked up to a dedicated
    port on a Consat, version 3.05 or later.  A PVC is configured for
    the subscriber to reach the Gateway.  The Telex machine must use
    EIA signal levels; if it uses Current Loop signalling, the machine
    requires a conversion.
 
    A subscriber with a PC is usually hooked up through modems and a
    dedicated line, to a dedicated port on any convenient Tymsat, and
    usually a PVC is configured.  The FMH software from FTCC is
    installed in the Customer's PC. Customers wanting non-PVC service,
    and/or dial-up, should discuss their needs with our
    representatives.
 
 
 
Signalling between the Gateway and the Telex Center
 
    Telex companies commonly interconnect from one to another using
    forms of trunk signalling which they designate Type-A, Type-B, and
    Type-C.
 
    The Gateway, as released, uses a certain combination of subscriber
    and Telex Type-A Trunk signalling.  A Telex center contemplating
    connection with Type-A signalling should check the details with our
    representatives.
 
    The Telex center must connect to a Tymnet Engine using EIA signal
    levels; Current-Loop signals must go through a signal converter.
 
    Type-B and Type-C signalling: The Gateway is flexible, and could be
    adapted for Type-B or Type-C signalling with a small development
    effort.
 
 
 
Store-and-Forward Service
 
    McDonnell-Douglas already offers a Telex Store-And-Forward service
    through Ontyme and FTCC.  The customer subscribes to Ontyme and to
    FTCC's MACS service.  The customer can then both prepare Telexes on
    Ontyme and receive Telexes; FTCC's MACS system periodically calls
    into Ontyme to pick up Telexes which the customer prepared and to
    give the customer all received messages.
 
    The customer uses any type of terminal which communicates with
    Ontyme.
 
 
 
Possible Additional Applications
 
    We have proposed enhancements to widen opportunities to provide
    customers with Telex service through Tymnet.  These enhancements
    are not presently scheduled, but will be prioritized if there is
    sufficient market.  The main proposals are:
 
      o Use of Ascii terminals through Tymnet for a) direct Telex
        transmission, and b) reception.
 
      o Direct connection of Ascii terminals through Tymnet to FTCC's
        MACS Store-and-Forward service, without Ontyme.
 
      o Use of Tymnet to connect Telex centers, either for a single
        Telex company or between companies, replacing their
        long-distance trunk lines with Tymnet service.
 
      o Use Tymnet to do dial-out service for a Telex company.  Telex
        companies presently use special hardware to perform dial-out
        to customers, and must do a hardware change for every customer
        update.
 
        Replace the Telex company's special hardware with software;
        simplify their updates of customers.  (The dial-out would most
        likely be performed in the Telex company's private Tymsat, and
        would not require additional Tymnet development outside of the
        Telex Gateway.  Particularly, this would not require Tymnet's
        proposed dial-out directory service, referred to as
        "out-dial".)
 
      o Permit Telex callers to log-in to arbitrary services on Tymnet.
        This would permit all Telex subscribers to use their Telex
        machine as a general-purpose terminal, for data base queries
        etc.
 
      o Telex service directly between two customers on Tymnet, without
        going through a Telex Switch.

      Merlin, new version 2.10, is now available on all Tymnet systems. 
   Changes in this version are:

   1). Merlin will now bind the Split-Kernel Supervisor.  Previously, files
       were loaded seperately through the Split-Kernel but now can be
       bound into a single loadable file.

   2). Bug fix for problem in how segments in Pascal slots tagged in the
       CTA table (for use by ISRS).

      If you have any questions on the new version of Merlin, please call me
   at (408)-942-5190 or send an Ontyme message to NSS.F/CHEN.

           QUESTION & ANSWER REGARDING CONTROL FIELD IN MUD BUFFER
           -------------------------------------------------------
           -------------------------------------------------------


Question by : Thomas Chow, Int'l Communication Consultant
Response by : Jeff Liu, HQ Network Staff Consultant




ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   'TYPE MUD' after a 'READ MUD' doesn't display the control field.  However, 
   after a 'READ CUD', the control field in the MUD buffer is shown.  Why is 
   the control field in MUD buffer displayed after a READ CUD instead of a 
   READ MUD?                                         --------
   --------



RESPONSE:

   In Netval version 1.14, 'TYPE MUD' after a 'READ MUD' doesn't display the
   Control field; but after 'READ CUD', a flag is turned on to display the
   control field and then 'TYPE MUD' will also display the control field
   identical to the control field of TYPE CUD.  If the operator wants to
   compare the CUD and MUD blocks, then use "COmpare" command to display
   the differences or output "NO DIFFERENCES" if all words are in the
   CUD and MUD blocks match.  "TYPE CUD" and "TYPE MUD" will not tell the
   operator if both blocks are identical since many fields are not displayed
   such as password.

   TRANSLATE ALL EBCDIC CHARS (HEX) INTO RECOGNIZABLE FORM FOR THE OPTION?




RESPONSE:
 
   The chart you requested can be found on the TYMNET ENGINE POCKET GUIDE, 
   page 5 and 6.  Besides this, there are several rules you can follow
   to define the disconnect message in MSGTEX:
 
   1. Upper case alphabetic characters A to Z can all be defined by graphic 
      symbols, ended with a period.
 
   2. Space (HEX 40) can be defined as SP. (note: also ends with a period).
 
   3. Other characters, including the lower case characters, numerical
      characters, and other symbols have to be entered by their HEX values.
      They do not need to be followed by a period.
 
   4. The 2 digit's HEX value will not be accepted by NAD, at gen time, if it 
      starts with the alphabetical character: A to F.  To avoid that, add an
      '0' before this value. 
 
   5. The message will be put into specific memory location preceeded by the 
      control unit address and device address and ready to send out at the 
      appropriate time.
 
      The disconnect message you indicated can be defined as follows:
      MSGTEX(00,06,L.,O.,G.,F.,F.,04,06,01,06,83,00,0F3,00)
 
      Please note that since this message is a long read format, you might 
      need to add an AID followed by 2 bytes cursor address in front of the
      whole message. Please discuss with the customer on this issue.

      ASSOCIATED PRINTER SUPPORT FOR CMT MODE FOR A TOTAL OF 255 DEVICES
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      ------------------------------------------------------------------


Question by : Carolyn Weidner, Tymnet Communication Consultant
Response by : Dianna Tai, HQ Network Staff Consultant

  


ORIGINAL QUESTION:

   A customer currently has 128 ports which are specific targetted.  Patch 
   located under (DTAI:54)ITT128.PAT was written to permit 128 devices.  The 
   customer now requests associated printer support for these devices.  I have 
   been told that we can support a total of 255 devices per interface.  Should
   I interpret this as eight complete control units, or eight control units 
   minus one device?  What restrictions should I be aware of when attempting 
   this?  (ex.-number of simultaneious users, targetting restrictions, is this
   patch still valid, core requirements, has this ever been done before) 






RESPONSE:

   1. PBH, as well as, PBT can only support up to 255 devices per slot.
      That is, 8 control unit minus one device.

   2. The number of simultaneous users to be defined in the tymfile depends 
      on the load of the node and traffic.  However, I have seen 101 and 127.

   3. Targetting restrictions -- what is your concerns here?  You can use wild
      card or you can also use one-to-one mapping.  It depends on how you 
      define them in the CMT tymfile.

   4. The patch ITT128.PAT has been incorported into the SOURCE patch 
      PBH07.P03.  Please remove the ITT128.PAT from your command file.

   5. According to PBH07.X03, 255 devices need 244K core memory.  We have 
      genned a PBH 7.03 here with 255 devices (combination of 1920 bytes 
      CRTs and Printers) of 127 simultaneous users and got 214K memory 
      requirement.

   6. I have seen configurations using CMT that have 50 CRTs and 50 PRTs
      defined in the PBH 7.03 and PBH 7.05 and up to 101 simultaneous users
      in macro HSTPRT.  But not 255 devices.

Response  by : Norman Chin




ORIGINAL QUESTIONS:

   1. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF COM (CMT OPERATIONS MONITOR)?  IS THIS INTENDED 
      TO BE A CUSTOMER-USABLE PRODUCT LIKE TOM?  ARE THE FEATURES IT ADVER-
      TIZES IN THE CMTI.ERS MANUAL GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED (THE ONLY THING I
      CAN GET TO WORK IS THE REAL-TIME RING TRACE), AND IN WHAT VERSION?

   2. WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF THE STATUS LINE FEATURE IN CMT? LAST TIME I 
      HEARD THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS.  ALSO WHAT VERSION OF CODE IS IT 
      IMPLEMENTED IN?

   3. WHAT VERSION OF CODE IS THE TEMPUSLINK FILE TRANSFER OPTION IMPLEMENTED
      IN?  HOW DOES IT WORK AND HOW WELL DOES IT WORK?  WHO HAS TESTED IT?





RESPONSE:
 
1. COM.
   The purpose of COM is to help us monitor the activities of the rings
   and to help us in our debugging.  It is intended to be used by HQTECH,
   NTD, and even you when something needs to be monitored.  It is not
   intended for customer use like TOM.  This tool is implemented in
   version 3.00 and any new versions after.  All features advertised on
   the CMTI.ERS manual are implemented.  If you find anything not working
   the way it is advertised, please contact us.  Please be sure to test
   on version 3.00 when you are using COM and not 2.06.
 
2. Status line.
   Status line is implemented on version 3.00.  Currently, we have a few
   betatest customers running this version and are happy with it.  Any
   problems that were brought to our attention have been resolved by NTD.
   If you know of any problems that I don't know of, please let me know.
 
3. TEMPUSLINK file transfer.
   TEMPUSLINK is a package running on the PC and on the host application to
   allow file transfer to work.  There is a customer (CHRYSLER) which uses
   this package going through CMTI (2.06) with a 3101 emulation selection.
   Any versions after 2.06 would also support file transfer but only a few
   terminal emulation macros (eg. VT100M, CM3101) have this capability.

      Network Console, in Public Net, has been updated from version 2.07
   to 3.01 since April 23.  The command to exit XOM and get back to NTCN is 
   changed to "RETurn".  "DISconnect" is not a valid command for 3.01.

      There are tho methods of implementating nodecode with all SIO, and
   no sync, in an Isis environment:

      1. Use a dummy sync line definition for nodecode.  Specifically,
         set the NLINES to equate to 1, and use one S.REF statement
         for slot zero.

         This applies to full release status nodecode version 5.06 and
         limited release status nodecode version 5.07.

      2. Upgrade to betatest status nodecode version 5.10, which does
         require a betatest agreement.


      If the customer is a good candidate for betatesting, we would welcome 
   additional betatest sites.  I refer you to John Gomes, manager of HQ 
   Quality Assurance, for betatest agreements.

   NEW PATCHES ADDED TO THE (SOURCE)RAM.P07 FILE ARE:

   (1)  RAM can now process a five bit termination code. The termination
        code is contained in accounting message 14 subtype 0 message 
        type 0. The maximun vlue of the determination code is (26)d.  
        Before the implementation of the patch, RAM could only interprete
        a maximun determination code of (15)d.

   (2)  A patch has been added to correct the block count in the 
        EOF1 record. The block count is now being incremented at the
        time RAM is required to write a block of data to tape due to
        a time-out.  A time-out occurs approximately every 15 minutes.
        If the tape data is blocked, there may be an incomplete block
        that has to be written to tape.

   FCO RELEASE:

   Field Change Orders (FCOs) have been released to resolve the problem of a
   false single-bit parity error in MAC-II:

                     .FCO 85-462  CAS Timing Change
                     .FCO 85-418  ERO Change

   The above, are co-requisites; the pair must be installed.  Also, the 
   machine must be brought up to current revision level.


   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

   Due to a hardware timing problem, a memory fetch request results in a 
   "false" single-bit parity error and "false" data fetched.


   SYMPTOMS/DETECTION:

   The primary symptom is that a crash occurs due to an illegal instruction or
   illegal memory reference that is, in fact, NOT illegal.  Once, a dispatcher
   crash was caused by this problem.

   Supporting evidence is occurrence of the single-bit parity error a short 
   time before the crash - a few seconds - on chip numbers that are a multiple
   of 22:
                  .22, 44, 66, 88, 110, 132, 154 and 176.

   To determine existence of single-bit parity error:
      .Use DDT ?MEM for ISIS nodes
      .Use XRAY QE for SOLO nodes.
