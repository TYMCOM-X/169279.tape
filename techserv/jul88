VT100 Key Sequences
     
QUESTION
 
Customer is trying to certify their PC software with us.  However, they
claim that we are not sending correct sequences from CMT for the
following VT100 keys:

I hope the following information will clear up any questions your
customer had about CMT VT100 key sequences.  
     
OPTION      VT100 to CMT      CMT to VT100   
     
CLEAR       Control C         "1B" "5B" 2J  "1B" "5B" H
     
HOME        Escape H          "1B" "5B" H    
     
RESET       Control R         "1B" "5B" 0Q   
     
(Any value between quotes is a HEX value)    
     
For the ERASE INPUT option, the 3270 type terminal has a key which will    
erase all unprotected fields and home the cursor, this option is not  
supported in version 3.00 of CMT. Your customer can accomplish the erase   
input through multiple manipulations of the keys to erase to end of field  
and then home the cursor.

X.PC - Troubleshooting

Introduction
 
The problem with X.PC is that end users like to blame all of their
problems on it.  They don't realize that there are more things in life
which cause them agony other than X.PC.  Consequently, the first thing
which needs to be done is to eliminate the possible points of failure
one by one.  Remember the first rule of troubleshooting:

               "Don't overlook the obvious!".
 
I have given some sample questions which should help you in the process
of elimination.  I have sectioned them into the usual problem areas.  I
have also included a list of suggestions based on which category the
problem fits into.
 
X.PC -- POSSIBLE POINTS OF FAILURE :
 
         I                        II              III            IV
|----------------------|  |---------------| |-------------|  |---------|
terminal - modem - telco - modem - consat - nip - X.PC slot - nip - hif

            nip is node in path 
            hif is host interface
            host interface includes the modems, telco, engine and customer
            equipment

QUESTIONS TO ASK THE CUSTOMER :

Your mission:     What are the symptoms?

Ask yourself:     Is this really an X.PC problem?

     END USER ERROR, TERINAL OR MODEM OF CUSTOMER:

          Can you walk me through what you are doing?  Get steps.
          Did they set up X.PC on the P.C. or modem?
          Did the phone dial out to the consat?  

     MODEM, CONSAT OR TYMNET NODE PROBLEMS:

          Receiving answer from consat modem?
          What node and port? 

     USERNAME PROBLEM, X.PC SLOT PROBLEM:

          What is the X.PC username? (don't ask for password, isistech works)
          Did the X.PC slot answer?

     HOST INTERFACE OR HOST PROBLEM :

          Did they make a call to the host?
          Were they connected?
          What are they experiencing once connected?
          Receiving any error messages?

     NODE IN PATH: 

          Is the problem slow response time?

POSSIBLE ACTIONS :

     Check customer's configurations.  Parity, speed, etc.
    
     Usual modem and consat troubleshooting.

     Check the username, where is it homed?  Sometimes a user is getting
     routed to x.pc by accident, while other times they want to go there but
     the username is homed wrong.

YOU DECIDE IT IS AN X.PC SLOT PROBLEM :

HANG AFTER BANNER :

     Hang after banner usually the problem is in the PC side

     Example: 

     After x.pc server sent 6 escapes, PC never send a Restart Request or
     server send Restart Confirm to PC but PC never response with Receive
     Ready packet, or PC application send an incomplete string for log in to
     the host etc...  The setting at PC side has to be reviewed.
           
     How to get information: 

     Call X.PC support to have direct test with the customer who has the
     problem or
    
     Log in "isistech:1650;password", slot 3 (This is a test slot, please call
     Jeff Liu and check if the slot is in use or the right code is loaded).

     Type "? stat"
      
     Type "> DPTF" to monitor the packets in and out.
      
     If the user gets hung, then type "\" and "> DR" command to see the ring
     dump.

     Capture the above information then send to X.PC support.
      
     If test slot works fine then let customer try to access the public slot
     again.  In case of failure, issue ?ct and ?bt ?brr 0 10 several times, 
     then dump the slot.
    
HANG AFTER PASSWORD : 
 
X.PC user encountered several hangs after user typed the password.  This
hang problem may be related to the X.PC Driver or X.PC Server.  If it is
caused by the server, it will have the following symptoms :
 
     CS will get more complaints from users. Not one or two calls, but many
     calls.
 
     In the case of many users hanging after password, log in to DDT for each
     x.pc slot and issue ?cpu.
 
     ?host
 
     ?cpu
 
     SLOT           RATE            RATE           RING          STATS 
                    USER           SYSTEM         ICPS           OCPS
 
     FF              10               0
      0              47               7            460            404
      1               0               0              0              0
      2               0               0              0              0
      3              23               8            156            396(xpc slot)
 
When both ICPS and OCPS show 0 instead of a non-zero value, such as 156
and 396, then this is the slot where all users get hang.
 
Procedure for CS to detect and Troubleshoot the Hang problem: 
 
     Log in to each X.PC slot and issue ?CPU to see if ICPS and OCPS are both
     equal to zero and ?host shows many ports in use, then immediately call
     X.PC support (see your support list).
 
     If you can not reach any support within 20  minutes then issue the
     following ddt commands a couple of times for the the slot which hangs
     the users :

                      ? CT
                      ? BT
                      ? BRR 0 10
                         ...
                         ...
                      ? BT
                      ? BRR 0 10
 
     Record the output of these commands AND send it to QSATS.
 
     After issuing the above commands dump the slot and bring the slot up
     immediately so that X.PC can function normally again.
 
     HOST PROBLEMS: 

     Log in directly, bypass the X.PC to do regular
     troubleshooting.
 
     The customer can connect after a long wait, or the customer will get
     slow response time.  Do a circuit trace.  One bad node can really slow
     things down.  Look for circuit overloads, etc.  Treat as a slow response
     problem, not X.PC, unless a circuit trace to both X.PC and from X.PC to
     host is clean.

Periodic Maintenance Tickets
       
The Network Systems Support Center (NSSC) will, as of 1 June 88, begin
to open tickets for Preventive Maintenance which has been scheduled for
private network and subnetwork equipment.  The sole purpose of the
Preventive Maintenance tickets will be to provide a vehicle by which
activities related to Preventive Maintenance service may be recorded for
later evaluation.
 
HOW IT'LL WORK:
       
       * Network Systems Company  "project"  personnel  who  currently 
           support a private network or subnetwork will be expected to 
           obtain a Preventive Maintenance schedule from the customer.  
 
       * Not less than 1  week  and  not  more  than  4  weeks  before 
           Preventive Maintenance is due,  the Network Systems Company 
           project  personnel  should  submit an ONTYME to TYMOPS.NSSC 
           indicating the date and time for the Preventive Maintenance 
           and the equipment to be serviced.  (NSSC  will  acknowledge 
           receipt of the ONTYME) 
           
       * Five working days before the scheduled date,  NSSC will:
           
	    (a) Open a trouble ticket for the Preventive Maintenance service. 

            (b) Open an Incident with the Field Service Companyand defer the
                dispatch until the scheduled date and time.  
 
       * If FSC problems are encountered at the  time  of  the  scheduled  
         Preventive  Maintenance  service,   NSSC  Operations personnel will 
         escalate  the  matter  to  the  appropriate manager  or  to  an  
         "on-call" manager who can react to the problem. 
          
       * NSSC  Operations  personnel  will provide code and diagnostic 
         loads  for  P.M.s  only  when customer personnel are not on 
         duty or when NSSC is providing network management  services 
         on that network or subnetwork.  
 
       * The  first  working  day  after  Preventive  Maintenance  was 
         scheduled,   NSSC   will  follow-up  with  the  customer  to 
         determine if the service was  satisfactory  and  will  then 
         close the ticket if service was provided as expected.  
 
       * If Preventive   Maintenance   service  was  not  provided  as 
         scheduled, NSSC will re-schedule the P.M.  with the customer 
         between  08:00  and  15:00 Eastern Time on the next working 
         day after the originally scheduled P.M.  If the service can 
         be re-scheduled within 48 hours, the original ticket will be 
         kept open.  Otherwise the original ticket  will  be  closed 
         and  a  new  ticket  will  be  opened  for  the re-scheduled 
         service.  
 
It should be noted that NSSC Operations personnel will not be
administering Preventive Maintenance tickets.  NSSC Operations personnel
will only make managerial escalations if a P.M.  is missed or if
problems are encountered with the P.M.  All administrative aspects of
Prevent Maintenance tickets will be handled by non-Operations personnel
between 08:00 and 15:00 Eastern Time Monday through Friday (holidays
excluded).
 
Personnel administering P.M.  tickets can be contacted via TYMOPS.NSSC
or by calling 800/345-6090 and asking for the P.M.  Administrator.

CMT to VT100 escape sequences for Control E, Control B  and Control H keys.    
     
The following explains how CMT responses to the Control E, Control B and   
Control H keys for the VT100 terminal.  
     
CONTROL E : Erase to End of Line.  
     
VT100 to CMT       CMT to VT100    
------------       ------------    
Control E          1B B7   20 20 20...   1B B8   1B 5B B1 6D or 1B 5B B0 6D
                   \---/   \---------/   \---/   \------------------------/
                    (1)        (2)        (3)               (4)  
     
1.   Save cursor sequence. CMT sends this sequence to the terminal to save  
     the current cursor position.   

2.   Spaces. CMT sends one space for each character being erased. 

3.   Restore cursor sequence. CMT sends this sequence to the terminal to
     restore the cursor to its original position.  

4.   High intensity or low intensity depending on the field's attribute.   CMT
     sends this sequence to the terminal to set the proper display intensity
     for the field.  
    
     1B 5B B1 6D = high intensity, 1B 5B B0 6D = low intensity.   

CONTROL B and CONTROL H : Backtab. 
     
VT100 to CMT       CMT to VT100    
------------       ------------    
Control B          1B 5B  RR RR  3B  CC CC  48    1B 5B B1 6D or 1B 5B B0 6D  

Control H          \-------------------------/    \------------------------/  

                               (1)                            (2)
     
1.  Move cursor sequence, where RR RR = Row and CC CC = Column.  

2.  High intensity or low intensity depending on the field's attribute.   CMT
    sends this sequence to the terminal to set the proper display intensity
    for the field.  

    1B 5B B1 6D = high intensity, 1B 5B B0 6D = low intensity.   
     
I understand that your customer is trying to implement some "home grown"
P.C.  software package emulating the VT100 terminal.  I am kind of
worried because if they don't implement the emulation correctly, we are
not going to be able to modify CMT's escape sequences to compensate for
their errors.  Please make sure that your customer completely understand
the way the escape sequences work as described above.

If you or your customer have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.
