      Recently I received an RFI from the field concerning the ACOUNT.DOC, a 
   reference manual describing our network's accounting system, which has been 
   updated as of Nov. 15, '85.  A few questions have arisen since within the
   preface of this document the ACCT2.DOC and Account-II system are referenced
   but with no clear indication explaining what they are.  Therefore I would
   like to share with you some of my knowledge about the legitimacy of these 
   documents and the status of the Account-II system project.


   (1)  About the ACCT2.DOC
    
         - Account-II system is a future system to replace the current
           Account-I system

         - The preliminary system specification is documented in the 
           ACCT2.DOC

         - The actual code implementation has yet to be started since
           considerable amount of changes for various s/w disciplines
           is anticipated within the network, such as RAM, ISIS, Node
           Code and other billing processes, etc.  It is expected the
           transition from the old system to the new one be as trans-
           parent as possible and the customers will be informed ahead
           of the time when such event occurs and be given detailed ins-
           tructions on systems deployment.

         - The major features of Account-II are:

                     0  multiple precision accounting message formats,
                     0  16 bits for host number,
                     0  48 bits for invoice/session number, etc.

         - Conservatively speaking, Account-II will not be in place in the
           public network until late this year or early '87.

         - The private networks will have to be upgraded to conform with
           the new system eventually.

   (2)  About the ACOUNT.DOC

         - The Nov. '84 version is still the great BIBLE.  The Nov. '85
           version was released a little too early for the actual functional
           design of the Consat/Outdial has just been completed.

         - The additional features in the Nov. '85 version primarily document
           the accounting behavior of the upcoming Consat/Outdial service
           which is currrently under development and won't be ready for beta-
           test until May.  In another words, the Nov. '85 document should not
           be accounted as a true reference manual until the Outdial s/w is 
           matured to complement the accounting system.

         - Basically the Outdial will utilize the existing ISIS B7 message to
           report the accounting addendum (to ISIS) for its sessions. (ISIS
           and Node Code will then send the information to the Sup through
           accounting message 14 over command circuit.)

         - I had requested the author of the document to comment properly
           in the Preface where ACOUNT.DOC is mentioned.  it should be worded
           as follows:

           "ACOUNT.DOC This document describes Tymnet accounting and will be
                       superceded by the ACCT2.DOC in the future when the
                       Account-II system is implemented."

      There are two independent "good guy" lists for Tymnet nodes:

         1.  The Isis good guy list for DDT users.

         2.  The Nodecode good guy list for XRAY users.


      The limitations for Nodecode/XRAY version 5.06 are:

         1.  Each entry requires 14 (decimal) bytes,
             (12 bytes are allocated for the username).

         2.  The maximum number of entries is 31 (decimal).


      The limitations for Isis/DDT version 5.08 are:

         1.  Each entry requires 12 (decimal) bytes,
             (8 bytes are allocated for the username).

         2.  The number of entries is not checked,
             i.e. there is no defined maximum.

   IMPORTANT INFORMATION

   1.  The new SNA/CMT full release product does NOT support printers!!!
       We are currently beta testing LU3 printer support for this product.

   2.  The IBM 3101 block mode in the 3270 Bisync host interface can only 
       support the 24PF keys when it is used with an IBM pc and Softerm from 
       Softronic as the terminal device.

   3.  The printer demo now has the Status line support in it.  Log in to 
       cmtdem1 thru cmtdem8 to show your prospects.  You can get additional
       information in the (dndspec:25)cmti.ers.      

      Congratulations are in order for John Gomes terminal verification group.
   They have put 19 products thru the program in 4Q85.  To get a list of all
   Async-to-3270 products (terminals and PC software) get the OnTyme file
   (*** asy/3270.lst or (compete:56)asy3270.lst).  This complete list now
   shows 82 terminals and software products as verified for use with Async-to-
   3270.  At this pace they should go over 100 this quarter.

                CAN A HIF SUPPORT A CU WHICH HAS 255 DEVICES
                --------------------------------------------

      In an IBM protocol, one CU can assign a unique address, up to 32 
   devices as shown below:

              CU or Device #        EBCDIC HEX
              --------------        ----------
                 0                       40
                 1                       C1
                 .                       .
                 .                       .
                31                       5F                            

      For a configuration having more than 32 devices, more CU(s) are 
   required.  To support  255 devices, you have to have at least 8 CUs, each 
   with a maximum of 32 devices defined in the DEFDEV macro.

      When the host accesses a device, it uses the CU address and the DEVICE
   address, defined in the tymfile, to uniquely select this device.  So even
   if we can define all these 255 devices in the tymfile by defining 8 CUs,
   all with the same CU addresses, as each device will have the same CU-DEVICE 
   address combination with 7 other devices, the HOST will have a problem in
   accessing the devices correctly.

             THE USE OF NMPORT, NSCNBF AND NBBFLT IN HIF TYMFILE
             ---------------------------------------------------
             ---------------------------------------------------

      The NMPORT and NSCNBF are only used for the Virtual Host Mode. If you 
   have CMT mode, defining them does not help the performance but does take up 
   memory space while genning the HIF. 
     
      If you let NBBFLT be defaulted and get a warning message during slot 
   gen, that is normal, simply just ignore it. However, if slot gen cannot be
   completed due to lack of memory space, then you need to modify the 
   configuration.

      The default for NBBFLT (# of big bufferlet) is based on the number of 
   lines and ports assigned to the interface. Each bufferlet has a fixed size 
   # of bytes (BBFLSZ=60 HEX). The formula to calculate the default in high 
   level language is:

      if NPORT > NDEVM then
         NBBFLT = (NDEVM + NBILIN*2) * MINBUF + BUFLO
      else
         NBBFLT = (NPORT + NBILIN*2) * MINBUF + BUFLO
      endif
      NBBFLT = NBBFLT + 80 (to insure got enough)


      (NBBFLT EQ -1 is a way of setting the bufferlets to maximum possible)
      Note:

      NFMPORT, NSCNBF, NBBFLT-- refer to I32RDH.DOC page 31 and 48.
      NPORT: # of ports
      NDEVM: # of devices
      NBILIN: # of bisync lines
      MINBUF: approx min # of buffers required per EDF MSG, set to HEX 10
      BUFLO: danger level for buffer free list, set to decimal 15.

      We all welcomed the NSR Database System, when it was introduced last
   March.  However, we soon realized there were some limitations which we
   could not live with.  One of these limitations was that only one user could
   make inquiries at a time.  That limitation is now history.  I have put
   together a program to circumvent this downfall.  All you need is access to
   the CCTS system via a logon ID and a password.  An initial procedure needs
   to be followed, but after that, a simple command will invoke the NSR system.
   The instructions follow:

   1)  Log on to the CTTS system:
          Please log in:  CTTSnnn^R^D;pw
          (nnn = your assigned id number; pw = the assigned password)

   2)  Copy the executive program (EXEC) to your system by doing the following
          LINK NSRRPT 191 199 RR NSRRPT
          ACC 199 G
          COPY NSRLINK EXEC G = = A
          REL G(DET
       (you only need to do this once.  Access to the NSR system will be
       limited to the following command:)

   3)  Invoke the NSR system:
          NSRLINK

      From this point on, you are in the NSR system.  Please contact me if you
   have any questions.  Happy NSRing!

      A word of caution. . .There are some limitations involved with using the
Concord 224 Autodial modems in conjunction with the current async outdial 
service.  Since the Concord 224 does not "wake up" until it receives dtr along
with a carriage return, the Tymcom will have to be set for psig(ifup).  This 
configuration ignores modem signals for all purposes for connection and 
disconnection.  It is preferrable to use the pcan(sig) option, but since the 
modem needs signals from the Tymcom first, this is impossible.  What will 
inevitably occur is a user landing on a port that has either no modem attached
or a defective modem or a loose cable and the call will stay connected.  
The user will have a hung session.

      Dave Peters, in Tymnet Marketing, is currently working with Concord to
reslove this issue.

      The following table indicates the memory requirements of an SNA 
   interface running either version 1.03 or 1.04 with different device
   configurations:


       TOTAL NO. OF DEVICES      
       (Any Combination of                  MEMORY REQUIRED    
       Printers and CRTs)                      (k-BYTE)
       ====================                 ===============

               16                              228
	
               32                              328

      General Guidelines:

        - Printer and CRT require the same amount of memory.

        - Although only 1.04 provides printer support, memory requirements
          for both 1.03 and 1.04 are very close.

        - The overhead of an SNA interface is about 135 K-byte and each
          device needs about 6 to 6.2 K-byte of memory.
      
        - At this point in time, no more than 96 devices are recommanded
          on each SNA interface.


      We will keep you all informed when further information on this subject
   is available.

               (The following note is in response to questions
               that have been asked since we recommended that all
               X.25/X.75 interfaces include the OUCH patch.)

      What does the OUCH patch do?

      The OUCH (OUt of CHannels) patch changes the method of determining the
   number of active ports in an interface.

      The original code incremented and decremented a counter when Ports were
   activated and cleared.  The OUCH patch uses a bit array to keep track of 
   the ports in use.  This array has a bit set for each port when it is in use
   and reset when it is cleared.  The OUCH patch counts the number of bits set
   to one and reports that number.

      The number of HOST PORTS AVAILABLE, the number of available channels and
   the HOST COST depend on this count of ports in use, and thus cannot always
   be relied upon for correct reports.  For example: at times the PORT counter
   method can not keep up with the real activity, and gives false reports, 
   causing an OUT OF CHANNELS message even though there are no users on the 
   line.  The HOST COST and HOST PORT AVAILABILITY algorithms are also 
   affected.

      We want you to avoid problems and suggest that if you do not already
   have the OUCH patch in your command file, that you use 

                              (HQXCOM)OUCHWK.301

   found on systems 25,54,70 or 33; OR USE (BETATEST)XCOM03.P01, instead of 
   the SOURCE patch file.

      If you are already using the OUCH.301 or OUCH.202 patch and do not have
   the HILCN packet option in your tymfile, there is no need to change.  The 
   OUCHWK.301 patch merely allows the inclusion of the HILCN option, but does
   not require it.

      If you have any more questions please contact Mary Lou Harline, ONTYME 
   NSS.M/HARLINE or phone (408) 942-5208.

                 PROCEDURE FOR ESCALATING A SUPERVISOR CRASH
                 -------------------------------------------
                 -------------------------------------------

      When the Supervisor crashes it saves the register values at the time of
   crash in the location CRSAVE and saves the data area at the time of the 
   crash in the crash save area on the disc. It then initializes. Part of the
   initalization process consists of writing zeroes on a major portion of the
   data area.   
     
      When taking a Supervisor dump perform the following steps: 
     
   1) Freeze the Supervisor.
     
   2) Log into NAD and set  up the proper Supervisor nib  
      file - the file that is running in the machine.
      Example:    
     
           %f   nibfile  
           %g  
           lo super 
     
   3) Build a circuit through NAD to the Supervisor slot. 
     
   4) Load the Crash data area from disc by doing    
     
           :ldsav1,savdsz/4,0 
     
   5) You may read out the contents of the registers by   
     
           :m1,crsave,crsave+48    
           :x1,4,2  
     
   6) Put the Supervisor machine in bootstrap.  
     
   7) Take the Supervisor memory dump using LOADII. Refer 
      to the MERLIN output for absolute beginning and
      ending addresses for the Supervisor slot and to page
      62 of tools and utilities document for dumping 
      procedure.  
     
   8) After taking the dump start up the system by   
      pushing the INI button on the console. The Sup 
      should come up sleeping.   
     
   9) Send in the standard escalation form. Include all   
      the information regarding the location of all the   
      files (including dump and log with merlin output). 
     
   10)It is also important to send the information about  
      how to access the private network - probe, xray and 
      ddt. This information should be only sent seperately
      to the person supporting the Supervisor - in the form    
      of ontyme or through telephone. The CC should include    
      his telephone number so that he can be reached.

   As the name  implies,  TMCS is a Monitoring and Control SYSTEM that must
   interact with  a  Network Event Monitor system for complete and accurate
   reporting of a networks' status.  Therefore a TMCS installation involves
   generating  and  installing code for two products, TMCS and NEM.  That's
   not  all,  both TMCS and NEM have seperate programs that must be used to
   maintain  the  disk  file  structures.  In  order  to  properly allocate 
   resources there are two seperate resource  estimator  programs that must
   be run.

   To  TMCS  installation  actually  requires  two  products, which in turn
   require  their  own  disk  maintainance and resource estimator programs.
   Installation will require the following steps:

       1.  Run TMRE to determine necessary resource allocations
       2.  Generate TMCS slot code 
       3.  Generate TMDM disk maintainance code
       4.  Load and execute TMDM
       5.  Load TMCS slot
       6.  Run NMRE for memory estimate and disk partitioning
       7.  Generate NMDM disk maintainance code 
       8.  Generate NEM slot code 
       9.  Load and execute NMDM 
      10.  Load NEM slot

   Once  the  software  is installed it is necessary to define  the network
   configuration  to  TMCS.   Network  configuration  assignments  must  be 
   defined accurately in order for TMCS properly report network conditions.  
   This is  done thru TMCS's Network Configuration Management command.  The 
   data managed by these commands can be divided into 5 groups:

       1.  Cluster Data
       2.  Host Location Data
       3.  Host Names Data
       4.  Node Names Data
       5.  XOM Host Data


   COMMON MISTAKES / PROBLEMS 

   .  TMCS will not recognize a node that has not been named, therefore that 
   node will not be reported.

   .  The TMCS display will report hosts missing if a host is assigned to a
   node that does not exist or if the host location is assigned to the wrong
   node or if the node has not been named.

   In  order  to  see  the node name and host location in the  TMCS  DISPLAY 
   command the following commands must be performed:

     SET NODE NAME
       syntax:   SET NODEs NAME nnnn name
       function: assign a name to node nnnn, as a means of tracking that
                 node more easily

     SET HOST LOCATION
       syntax:   SET HOST LOCATION {host#} {node#} [position]
       function: assign host locations used in the host missing list


   CONFIGURATION PARAMETER DEFINITIONS
   -----------------------------------

   Three parameter groups: 

        1.  NETWORK
        2.  TMCS
        3.  NEM

   NETWORK PARAMETERS ( .A FILE )

     Specify charateristics of the network to be monitored and MUST be
     properly defined for TMCS/NEM to operate properly and efficiently.
     They  play  a major  part  in determining the disk and core usage 
     requirements.

   TMCS PARAMETERS ( .A FILE )
  
     Defines the Concurrent Pascal Preprocessor configuration flags and
     parameters specific to TMCS.
         
     COMMON PITFALLS AND MISTAKES
                
       1.  Misspelling of  $ENABLE  or the  switch name  will produce 
           errors in CPPRO (v10.00 on)
               
       2.  Rule of thumb for most parameter text strings:
    
           String MUST end with a backslash "\" and have an EVEN number
           characters INCLUDING the "\"
              
       3.  Node_Mask and Host_Mask MUST be a POWER OF 2
           (ie. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, ...)
          
       4.  Node_Hash_Max & Host_Hash_Max  MUST be specified as a PRIME #
 
              
   NEM PARAMETERS ( .A FILE )

     Defines the configuration parameters that relate specifically to NEM
     and are necessary in determining disk and core usage.  They MUST be
     defined in the .A file for NEM.
      
     COMMON PITFALLS AND MISTAKES
           
       1.  The sup login string (ERLOG_TEXT) may have a max of 24 character
           between '  '

           NOTE:  the (:4:) counts as only one character

       2.  The Consumer_Max MUST be set to:

               1 > USER_MAX set for TMCS  
            or 2 > USER_MAX set for TMCS  with RELOAD ENABLEDD


   TYMFILE PARAMETERS (.T FILE)
   ----------------------------

     Configuration parameters from both ISIS and the PASCAL program are
     defined for the PASCAL Nucleus via the slot .T file.



   COMMAND FILE REMINDERS
   ----------------------

   TMCS
 
     1.  Check for Version # changes *** DON'T FORGET PNUC VERSION # ***
         
     2.  V10.00 and > MUST contain Concurrent Pascal Preprocessor
         
     3.  Important when upgrading versions of TMCS: verify patch file
         references are correct for new version.  Assembling in old  
         patches can cause numerous problems.
             
   TMDM
     
     1.  PCOM will hang because the COPY command line is too long.
         To get around this you can:

           1.  split COPY into two COPY command lines,  OR
           2.  run (UPL)COM instead 


   ESTIMATING RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
   --------------------------------

     TMRE v1.01 (for TMCS v7.05/7.08) output:
    
       1.  TOTAL NUMBER OF CYLINDERS needed by TMCS slot

           ****  Value from TMRE is decimal and MUST be  ****
           ****  converted to HEX for use in DSC file.   ****

       2.  Max number of nodes in a btree file -  btree_max parameter
       3.  MINIMUM MEMORY required for TMCS slot

           ****  ADD  10%  to memory estimate  ****

     TMRE v2.00 (for TMCS v10.00) output:
  
       1-2  Same output as v1.01 EXCEPT:

       3.  TMRE no longer gives estimates MINIMUM MEMORY requirements.  A
           formula will be available with the release documents to determine
           memory usage.


  
  
   GENERATION REQUIREMENTS

   This category describes additional actions need for TMCS and NEM
   to function.

           reconfigure the data base to be compatible with TMCS Version 10.0
           or 10.01
       3.  Gen and load TMCS Version 10.0 or 10.01

     Notes:

       o  If TMDM is interrupted while in the process of reconfiguring,
          the data base will most likely be destroyed; hence the importance 
          archiving the original data base.
   
      o  Because of a memory space limitation in the TMDM Version 1.03 code, 
         it is not possible to reconfigure a data base with this version of 
         TMDM once it has been configured to be compatible with Version 10.0 
         or 10.01

   II  Upgrading TMCS from Version 10.0 or 10.01 to Version 10.10
       ==========================================================

       1.  Archive the data base
       2.  Gen and load TMDM Version 2.0 and enter "RECONFIGURE" to
           reconfigure the data base to be compatible with TMCS Version 10.10
       3.  Gen and load TMCS Version 10.10

   III Upgrading TMCS from Version 7.5 or 7.8 to Version 10.10
       =======================================================
       1.  Archive the data base
       2.  Gen and load TMDM Version 1.03 and enter "RECONFIGURE" to
           reconfigure the data base to be compatible with TMCS Version 10.0
           or 10.01
       3.  Gen and load TMDM Version 2.0 and enter "RECONFIGURE" to

       4.  Gen and load TMCS Version 10.10
   


   TMCS COLOR TERMINAL CONTROL SEQUENCES

   As you are probably aware TMCS is capable of emulating different types
   of terminal/monitors.  Those currently supported are:
   
              BLACK/WHITE          COLOR
               o  ADM1              o  ISC2400
               o  ADM3              o  ISC8900
               o  HP2621
               o  SCANSET
               o  DEC VT100

   The following is a description of the control sequences used by the
   ISC2400 & ISC8900 color terminal.  This includes the special sequences
   for color LOG and DISPLAY output.
    

   The cursor function is listed with the decimal value equivalent.  The
   decimal value requires an ASCII character set equivalent.  The symbols
   are as follows:
   
         +     Specifies to concantenate the characters together, unless
               bounded by parentheses or angle brackets.  If  bounded by
               parenthesis or angle brackets add the numeric values.

         =     Specifies the literal equal sign.
       
        ( )    Specifies the  value  of  the  expression  is  a  single
               numeric character and should be translated as such.  For 
               example, if the value of the  expression  is  (14+1), it
               is translated into the ASCII equivalent of 15.

        < >    Specifies each numeric character needs to be translated. 
               For  example,  if  the  expression  is  <14+1>,  it  is 
               translated   into   the   ASCII   equivalent  of  the 
               characters 1 and 5.

ASYNC TO 3270 PRINTER SUPPORT--
 
    There are 4 ways to do 3287 printer emulation with Async to
    3270 Service:
 
            Local Terminal       IBM Host         IBM Host
          Controls Printing  Controls Printing Controls Printing
          (aux pt. attached) (aux pt. attached)(seperate circuit
                                                  attached)
           _____________________________________________________
           |                |                  |                |
OPTION 1   |     X          |                  |                |
           |________________|__________________|________________|
OPTION 2   |     X          |        X         |                |
           |________________|__________________|________________|

           |________________|__________________|________________|
OPTION 4   |                |                  |           X    |
           |________________|__________________|________________|
 
****NOTE:  OPTIONS 2, AND 3 REQUIRE UNIQUE NETWORK USER
           NAMES FOR EACH PAIR OF CRT AND PRINTER.  OPTION 4
           REQUIRES  A UNIQUE NETWORK USER NAME FOR EVERY
           PRINTER. IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS THE IBM HOST WILL HAVE
           NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT PRINTER BELONGS TO WHAT CRT
           USER.  THE END RESULT IS THAT END USERS GET
           MISDIRECTED PRINT JOBS
 
 
    OPTION 1.  LOCAL SCREEN COPY VIA AUXILIARY (AUX) PORT
        ATTACHED PRINTER
 
        the printer is attached to the aux port of the CRT or PC
        and only screen prints are required.  Many IBM
        applications only require this kind of printing.  This
        type of printing does NOT INVOLVE ANY TYMNET TECHNOLOGY
        and your customer should be cautioned to select terminal
        equipment that can do a print of the screen if this is
        what they want to use.
 
      Advantage:
        -reduces Kchar charges because no print data is sent
         across the network.
 
      Disadvantage:
        -no host initiated copy
        -not supported by all terminal types
 
 
    OPTION 2.  LOCAL SCREEN COPY AND HOST INITIATED PRINTING VIA
        AUXILIARY (AUX) PORT ATTACHED PRINTER ( 1Q86 available
        for BSC HIF , SNA/SDLC HIF LU3 or 3270 datastream
        only,beta test)
 
        allows an async, ASCII printer to be attached to the
        auxiliary port of a terminal or PC that has a
        controlable aux port.  Print jobs initiated by the host
        software can be sent to the printer which will appear to
        the host  as 3287 printer .  Async to 3270 Service will
        take care of routing the print job to the aux port of
        terminals and PC packages that can support this feature.
        Check the Ontyme file *** list.asymcto3270 for the list
        of terminals and PC software that supports host initiated
        print and check the manufactures documentation to see if
        the terminal or PC can do the local screen print.
 
        Advantages:
        -dial-up users can get a 3287 print job over a single
         connection
        -local copy is supported on terminals that have this
         feature
        -some PC's can gather the host print on the disk for
         printing off-line which improves operator efficiency
 
        Disadvantage:
        -CRT cannot be used while receiving a print because of
         the technical limitations of the terminal equipment
         available on the market today
        -CMT and HIF devices must be dedicated to each unique
         network user name that identifies a particular CRT and
         printer pair
 
    OPTION 3.  HOST INITIATED PRINTING VIA AUXILIARY (AUX) PORT
    ATTACHED PRINTER ( 1Q86 available for  BSC HIF , SNA/SDLC HIF
    LU3 or 3270 datastream only, beta test)
 
        This is the same as Option 2 except it is for terminals
        without local screen copy capability.  It allows an
        async, ASCII printer to be attached to the auxiliary port
        of a terminal or PC that has a controlable aux port.
        Print jobs initiated by the host software can be sent to
        the printer which will appear to the host as a 3287
        printer.  Async to 3270 Service will take care of routing
        the print job to the aux port of terminals and PC
        packages that can support this feature. Check the Ontyme
        file *** list.asyncto3270 for the list of terminals and
        PC software that supports host initiated print.
 
        Advantages:
        -dial-up users can get a 3287 print job over a single
         connection
        -some PC's can gather the host print on the disk for
         printing off-line which improves operator efficiency
 
        Disadvantage:
        -CRT cannot be used while receiving a print because of
         the technical limitations of the terminal equipment
         available on the market today
        -no local screen print available
 
        -CMT and HIF devices must be dedicated to each unique
         network user name that identifies a particular CRT and
         printer pair
 
    OPTION 4.  HOST INITIATED PRINTING ONLY VIA A SEPARATE
        CIRCUIT    (BSC HIF only)
 
        allows an async, ASCII printer to be shared among a group
        of terminal users.  The printer is connected by:
          1.  connecting the printer to an async terminal
              concentrator that supports PVC's
                                   OR
          2. the printer has a keyboard that is used to do the
             network logon and establish the circuit OR
          3. you can use a PAP (dial-up or leased) with a PVC
 
 
       Advantage:
        -allows any verified terminal to have 3287 printer
         emulation
        -allows colocated CRT's and PC'c to share the same
         printer; therby, reducing costs and improving efficiency
 
       Disadvantage:
        -no local copy function
        -you may pay for connect time for the printer
        -a device address must be dedicated to each printer on
         the BSC HIF
 
 
 
    NOTE:  There are many inexpensive printers available.  It is
usually desirable to chose a printer that has XON/XOFF flow
control and a serial port. Check the hardware manual for the
terminal to find the characteristics of its aux port and make
sure it is compatible with the printer--be particularly careful
about flow control, e.g., XON/XOFF (the best) or hardware
handshakeing CTS.  The IBM PC may be used with a parrall port
and printer.
 
        ALL PRINTERS MUST SUPPORT Carriage Return, Line Feed and
Form Feed and have sufficient columns for the application
 
WCC bit setting supported
    Alarm generates a Ascii Bell
    80 character line
    132 character line
    non-display
 
3287 Printer Orders supported
 
New Line tranlates to Ascii Line Feed and Carriage Return `0A0D'
 
Form Feed translates to Ascii Form Feed `0C'
 
Carriage Return translates Ascii Line Feed and Carriage Return
`0A0D'
 
End of Message will cause the CRT aux port to be turned off if
the printer is attached to the CRT's aux port

      TEST RESULTS TAKEN FROM THROUGHPUT TESTER READINGS OF TYMCOM 2.03
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      -----------------------------------------------------------------


Written by : Bryan Wing
      Date : Jan 27, 1986




   The following tables reflect results from many tests taken from throughput
   tester readings of Tymcom performance.  These results represent the best
   cases of closed environment tests.  Output totals declined rapidly once
   these values were attained.  No buffer zap messages were elicitted although
   I suspect data was lost.

   The intent of the tests was to find the peak output.  To do this, it was
   necessary to start at a low output and gradually increase the output level.
   Starting the throughput tester output at a high level, such as 240 cps,
   always produced horrible results.  Other readings showed identical results
   for a certain range of ports.  This leads me to distrust the throughput
   tester's readings to a degree.


   High speed interrupts were enabled and only slots (1) and (2) were 
   utilized.  Tymcom code ran in slot (1) and throughput tester code ran in 
   slot (2).  No synchronous input or output was involved except for channel
   (0) network communication.




   This first table represents the best, and I must repeat best, readings for
   (4) ports with throughput tester output set at 480 cps.


   CPS RATES:       INPUT       OUTPUT       COMBINED
       TOTAL:        1598         1416           3014
     AVERAGE:         399          354            753


   This second table represents the best results for (8) ports with throughput
   tester output set at 240 cps.


   CPS RATES:       INPUT       OUTPUT       COMBINED
       TOTAL:        2168         1928           4096
     AVERAGE:         271          241            512


   This third table represents the best results for (16) ports with throughput
   tester output set at 120 cps.

   CPS RATES:       INPUT       OUTPUT       COMBINED
    TOTAL:        2048         1617           3665
  AVERAGE:         128          101            229


   I must emphasize that these figures are very optomistic.  I have seen
   instances where throughput has been degraded with fewer async ports active
   and high speed interrupts are enabled.  Buffer zaps will occur especially
   with high input levels.  In extreme cases, I would not count out a crash
   of the slot.  This is as definitive an answer that is available at this 
   time.  This is for Tymcom code only.  Consat code performs much worse.

   I have attached, below, the throughput statistics (by Dave Smith) for
   version 2.00 & 2.01:


               ASYNC TYMCOM VERSION 2.00 THROUGHPUT STATISTICS
               -----------------------------------------------
               -----------------------------------------------


   Many of you have asked for publishable throughput statistics for the 
   Version 2.00 Async Tymcom slot.  The following statistics have been 
   released by NTD, and can be found in the document (BASELINE:39,25,70)
   ACOM02.Y01.  

   The tests were done first for Version 2.00 in foreground, then for Version
   2.01 in background.  The data flow originated at a throughput host slot,
   residing in te same node as the Async Tymcom slot, acting as 15 user
   terminals.  The conclusion is that data in this direction can be compared
   to data originating at the host.  Because the throughput host resided in 
   the same node, bandwidth considerations were not necessary.  The CPU
   utilized by the throughput host could be compared to the node code CPU use,
   if necessary.

   The data was specified as burst size 10, cps 120.  This meant the data was
   received at the Tymcom slot in 10 character messages at an approximate rate
   equal to a 1200 baud terminal.

   Note:  the ideal, non-degraded throughput would be 1800 CPS for one 
   direction, 3600 bi-directional.  The formula:  
              
                       15 ports X 120 CPS =  1800 CPS

   I. What is Menu Service ?

       A Tymnet software product that provides a very friendly menu screen,
       allows users easy access to a variety of hosts and network services.

       The key words are : friendly menu screen
                           easy access
                           variety of hosts and network services.

   II. The Advantages of Using Menu Service

       - Friendly Menu Screen
         It is 100% configurable. Customers have choices of having broadcast
         messages or not, one menu or multiple menus, what to display on 
         screen, what to use for selection fields.

       - Easy Access
         One login sequence versus multiple login sequences, eliminate keying
         errors.

       - Variety of Hosts and Network Services
         This includes Tymnet or outside information vendors. Customers can
         store all kinds of services in one place.

       - Other Good Features
         * Multiple Logical Slots (16 per physical slot)
           Allows customers to set up multiple levels of user accessing.
         * Inactivity Timer
           Saves connect charges if service is not in use.
         * AutoLogin/AutoLogoff
           Special application when customers choose not to have screen 
           displays.
         * Password Option
           Depends on the application, customers can choose to have users key
           in passwords or to have passwords kept in the Sysgen file (of cause
           we can use Cipher to achieve the security protection).
         * Project Code Collecting
           Very good feature for costs/expenses distributing.


   III. Things to Watch Out For

       - Password Option
         This is not for keeping unauthorized users out from accessing to the
         Menu slot. This is to give the customers the flexibility of what to
         do with the passwords.

       - No Way Out
         This is the most critical issue. Users do not have a good way to
         interrupt circuit building, cases like incorrect selections or
         unsuccessful logins. The only way to get out of the waiting would
         be "put the terminal offline".
         Bug report has been sent to NTD. So far, it's not resolved yet.

       - Screen Echo Problem
         Put CMT and Menu Service together, sometimes it will cause some 
         characters not being displayed. HQTECH is working together with NTD
         on this problem. At this stage, we don't know the cause of the 
         problem yet.
   
       - Sup Timeout When Using Manual Login Problem
         Manual Login is one of the nice features in Menu Service. But
         if the user does not send in login sequence in time, the Sup timeout
         sometimes will cause slot to be halted. This is a known problem
         to NTD and us.

   IV. Marketing Information
   
       Menu Service is in Limited Release phase right now. So far, we have
       6 customers in PublicNet. There are several PrivateNet customers
       show great interests in it as we were told. But they would probably
       prefer to make the decision when it's in full release. The general 
       concern from the sales is we don't have a External Reference Spec. 
       Marketing is working on this issue.

  SECTION 1.0 Overview
  --------------------
  The NETVAL program is used to validate TYMNET network users  and  to
  determine  how much access a user has within a network.  NETVAL runs
  in a slot in the Internally Switched Interface System  (ISIS)  on  a
  TYMNET node.

  SECTION 2.0 Concept
  -------------------
  The CUD, or Controlling User Directory, is a file which contains  an
  entry for each valid user in the network.  When changes are made via
  NETVAL, they are made directly to CUD file a record of  each  change
  also appended to the MUDUPDATE file.

  The MUD, or Master User Directory.  Each supervisor in  the  network
  has its own copy of the CUD on its own disk, reffered to as the MUD.

  In order for the supervisors to be accessing up-to-date data, NETVAL
  uses the information in the MUDUPDATE file to notify each Supervisor
  of all the CUD changes.  There is  an  automatic  process  for  each
  supervisor of the change.

  SECTION 2.1 CUD MUD Contents
  ----------------------------
  USERNAME : Up to 20 characters.  The acceptable  characters  consist
             of:
      1.  all alph-numeric characters.
      2.  the characters: <space>   $  *  , .  - /
  ENTRY CHANGE DATE PASSWORD CIPHER : Up to 30 characters any character
      other than a semicolon, null, rub-out, escape, or carriage return
      may be useed.  
  PASSWORD  CHANGEDATE 
  UNIVERSAL  USER  NAME (UUN) : 0 - 37777777777 (octal).  
  GLOBAL ACCOUNT NUMBER (GAN) - optional : Group user together under a
      single account.   range  0  - 37777777777.  
  CONTROL OPTIONS :
      AUDITOR OPERATOR 
      ACCOUNT SUPERVISOR
      NETWORK SUPERVISOR
      IGNORE HOST 
      NO PASSWORD
      SHUT OVERRIDE
      TRANSPARENT LOGIN
      DISTRICT  - optional 
  HOME : A default termination point for a  circuit  if no termination
         host is included in the login string or if the user  has  the
         ignore host option. 
  HOST : A host number is an address antity in  the network from which
         a  circuit  can  be  built.
  ACCESS PROFILE
      ORIGIN : Class.
      DESTINATION : Group.




  SECTION 3.0 Supervisor updating
  -------------------------------
  Netval is a Network Validation program  that  allows  validators  to
  make  changes  to  network validation data on the Netval system, and
  automatically transmits these changes to network Supervisors.  These
  data that is handled by Netval includes:

  1. CUD/MUD Information:
     When a user attempts to login through the network, the Supervisor
     uses the  information  in  its  MUD to determine the user's legal
     access.
     * Is the user name in MUD?
     * Is the passwords correct?
     * Can  user  originate  from the node or host that he is entering
       the network from?
     * Can user access the host specified as a destination?
     * Which  host  should  the user  be  routed  to  if there is none
       specified in the login string? etc.

  2. Class/group information
  Part of the user's CUD/MUD entry contains access information,  i.e.,
  legal network origins and destination for users.

  CLASS : is a  globally  defined  set  of  originating  hosts  and/or
  originating nodes, which are used to define the locations from which
  a user may access the network (ORIGINS).   GROUP  :  is  a  globally
  defined  set  of host numbers.  Groups are used to define the set of
  host to which a user may build a circuit.  (DESTINATION).

  Netval maintains information about Classes and groups, and generates
  a  copy  of  supervisor  Class/group Table; each supervisor uses its
  Class/ Group Table when a user is logging  in,  and  the  users  MUD
  entry refers to a CLASS an origin or a GROUP as a destination.

  In both above cases, validators login to Netval and make changes  to
  Netval  information.   Netval  then  transmits  the  changes  to the
  supervisors.

  When transmitting CUD data, Netval communicates with the  UN2  slave
  part  of  the supervisor; When transmitting Class/Group data, Netval
  communicates with the SYSMSG1 Slave part of the Supervisor.

  It is important that the validation information gets updated on  the
  Supervisors  in  a timely manner.  Out-of-date information may cause
  users to lose access through the network, or may grant access  to  a
  user that should no longer have it.  

  Netval maintains a list of "legal" supervisors, the supervisors that
  have  been  turned  "on"  in Netval with the SET SUPERVISOR Command.
  There are the supervisors that Netval will  update  when  there  are
  changes made to CUD or Class/Group Table.
    



  READ TABLE  comman  allows  the  validator  to display a Class/Group
  table.
  If the  optional  argument <sup> is included, the supervisor's table
  will  be read  and  displayed.  if the argument is omitted, NETVAL's 
  table will be displayed.

  SECTION 3.1 MUD Updating
  ------------------------
  When a modification is made to the Netval CUD, a description of  the
  change  is appended to the MUDUPDATE file.  An automatic process for
  each supervisor is notified that there is a change  to  be  sent,  a
  circuit  is  built  to  Supervisor,  and  the  change is transmitted
  through the network.  Only the changed information is sent.
  Network keeps track of how much data is in the file (the  file  EOF)
  and  the  point to which each Supervisor has been updated.  When the
  data has been sent to all legal supervisors, the EOF is set to 0.
  If a supervisor is "Down" (inaccessible to Netval) for a  period  of
  times  the  data  in the MUDUPDATE file may come close to filling up
  the file.  If the MUDUPDATE file ever becomes full, VALIDATORS  WILL
  NO  LONGER  BE ABLE TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE CUD.  A supervisor may be
  turned "off" with the SET SUPERVISOR s OFF command.

  CONSISTENCY :
     * SET SCHEDULE  Command, once a day a consistency process is run.
     * RUN_AUTO_CONSISTENCY_ON_SUP_INIT  parameter  set to true in the
       config  file, a consistency  will  start  up  immediately  when
       the SET SUPERVISOR  command is executed. 
     * Manual  consistency  is  run  whenever  there  is a doubt as to
       whether the MUD contains up-to-date information.

       It compares  checksums  between  CUD and MUD blocks, and if the
       MUD checksum does  not  match  the  CUD checksum, the CUD block 
       data is to be stored in the MUD.



  SECTION 3.2 Class/group Table Updating
  --------------------------------------
  The  Class/Group  Table  information  is   maintained   by   Network
  Administrator validators.  When the class/group Table is ready to be
  transmitted to the supervisors the SEND command is executed.
  This causes a date (class/group table last created) to be set to the
  current  time.   An automatic process continually compares this time
  against the time that the table was last sent  to  each  Supervisor,
  and  if  necessary, transmits a copy of the Table to any out-of-date
  Supervisors.

  SECTION 4.0 Operator Log
  ------------------------
  Netval maintains a log of information about critical events  in  the
  Netval system, This includes validator logins, logouts, disk errors,
  and  the  execution   of   critical   operational   commands(Setting
  Supervisors,    consistency,   schedule,   etc.).    If   the   flag
  CHANGE_TO_OPERLOG is enabled in the Netval configuration  file.  The
  MESSAGE command is used to display information from the operator log
  file.


  SECTION 5.0 Logical Volumes
  ---------------------------
  In NETVAL version 3, if the configuration  parameter LOGICAL_VOLUMES
  is  Enabled in the Netval configuration file, the engine must have 2
  physical disk drives.  An ISIS  logical  unit  is  defined  on  each
  physical disk drives for the CUD and file system.  The "CUD" logical
  units include the CUD and the CUD parameter file; the "file  system"
  logical units include all other Netval files.

  SECTION 5.1 Logical Volume Commands
  -----------------------------------
  COPY : The COPY commands causes data to be read  from  one  physical
  disk  (in  read/write  state)  and copies to the same sectors on the
  other physical disk (in the down or offline state).  Once  the  copy
  operation  starts,  the state of the disk being copied TO is changed
  to write only.  At the end of COPY command, the state  of  the  disk
  being copied TO is changed to read/write state.

  If  neither  disk  is  down  or offline, the user receives the error
  message:
       one disk must be down or offline
  IF a copy is already being performed  on  the  system, user receives
  message:
       A copy is already in progress

  If the above  criteria  are  satisfied,  the  COPY  Command  display
  Logical  volume  information,  and  prompts  for confirmation of the
  direction of the copy.

  DISPLAY LVOL: It will display current  logical  volume  information.
  It can be used to monitor the current drive states.

  SET Drive d OFFLine : It will set the specified drive,  "d"  to  the
  offline  state;  it  should  be  used by an operator when a drive is
  known to be faulty, the data on a disk is suspect, or when preparing
  to remove a pack from the system.

  SECTION 7.0 NETVAL Disk Maintenance Program (NVDM)
  --------------------------------------------------
  NETVAL Disk Maintenance Program (NVDM) is used  to  perform  certain
  NETVAL  disk and tape operations.  The NVDM program runs in the same
  ISIS slot as NETVAL, but not at the same time.

  NVDM is used to initialize  or  reformat  the  NETVAL  disk  and  to
  reconfigure  files.   NVDM  is also used to display information from
  the NETVAL disk.

  NVDM has its own archive subsystem, which is used  to  perform  tape
  operations.   The  NVDM  user  can use the NVDM archive subsystem to
  restore files from tape to disk.  All tape files can be restored  in
  one  operation.   Some specific files such as the CUD file, can also
  be restored.

  Only the NETVAL user at highest authorization level and a  specially
  designed NVDM operator validator are authorized to use NVDM.

       Current fully relesed versions of RAM are RAM  version  10.05  and
       RAM  version  10.07.   Current  Betatest  versions  of RAM are RAM
       version 11.04 and RAM version 11.05.  

       Problems that  may  be  encountered  in  the  operation  of  these
       versions are:

         o  For Versions other than 11.05, RAM goes haywire if all slaves
            are declared down and RAM is allowed to RUN.

         o  RAM may at times have a communication problem with the slaves
            which  is  often  corrected by issuing a SLAVE/UP command for
            the slave in question.

         o  RAM may need to be  restarted  due  to  a  crash,  change  of
            version,  or  necessity  for disk or tape maintenance.  It is
            best to  restaret  RAM  with  a  WARMSTART  command  whenever
            possible.  If a new version of RAM is loaded or the data from
            the last RAM backup no longer resides on  the  RAM  disk,  it
            will  be  necessary  to  follow  the  COLDSTART  procedure as
            outlined in the RAM Operator Guide.  If  the  crash  occurred
            while  RAM  was in the RUN state, it is likely that RAM would
            have stopped in the middle of a  file  and  consequently  the
            tape  would not have been ended with two tape marks.  If this
            should happen and RAM does not require  a  COLDSTART,  it  is
            best  to  use  the  ATTACH/BACK  and  WARMSTART  commands  to
            reposition the tape at the point of the last backup  and  RAM
            will  continue  processing from the point of the last backup.
            The ATTACH/BACK command has a bug in version 10.05.

         o  Use of the SETBLOCK command without issueing a  COLDSTART  in
            conjunction  with  the  SETBLOCK command can cause incomplete
            sessions to be written to tape.  This  could  happen  if  RAM
            were  instructed  to recollect previously collected SUP data.
            The COLDSTART command clears the  table  RAM  uses  to  track
            session records.

         o  If RAM generates a tape that is unreadable, there could be  a
            problem  in  recreating  the  tape.   Version  11.05 has tape
            duplication capabilities as long as the tape has been  backed
            up  to  disk.   An option exists in version 11.05 to backup a
            specified number of tape images to  disk.   It  is  virtually
            impossible  to  recollect  RAM  data and expect to produce an
            exact image of a previous tape.  A set of tapes collected  on
            one  drive  and  a  second  set of tapes collected on another
            drive can produce two  sets  containing  complete  accounting
            data  if  the  procedure  is  followed as outlined in the RAM
            Operators Guide.  The procedure requires that the  collection
            process  for  each tape begin with a COLDSTART and end with a
            DRAIN.  The  DRAIN  writes  out  incomplete  session  records
            remaining in memory.

         o  If a second tape unit is attached and on-line when the  first
            unit  fails,  RAM  will write to the tape on the second unit.
            However the labeling information for the second tape will  be
            the same as that for the first tape.

         o  RAM's normal collection process may be interrupted  following
            a  DUMP  command  if  the  RAM pointer is not reset.  (May be
            reset by the SETBLOCK command)

         o  The RAM session pool will fill up frequently  if  not  enough
            memory  is  allocated  for  the  expected load of the Network
            involved.

         o  Testing RAM with continual logons will  produce  an  abnormal
            number of sessions and cause the session pool to fill.

         o  RAM may report that the disk is down if  the  wrong  type  of
            disk  controller  is  specified  in  the  slot tymfile or not
            enough space was allocated for a disk backup in the DSC file.

         o  If only one supervisor is reported on the status report  with
            possibly  the  wrong  number, it could be that a count of the
            number of  supervisors  was  given  in  the  SUPERS  paramter
            instead of each supervisors number.

         o  Garbage such as host numbers and passwords  may  show  up  in
            RAM's  project code field depending on how interfaces such as
            the TYMCOM are set up to report this  data.   This  might  be
            avoided  by  regenning  the interface not to report a project
            code or have the interface specify  to  the  ISIS  delimiters
            such  as  a  carriage  return or ";" in receiving the project
            code.

         o  The report generated by the STATUS command will  not  reflect
            the  results  of  the  SETBLOCK  command  until after the RUN
            command is executed.

     Version 3.01 of the XCOM code allows for much larger systems
     than previous versions.  BIGIO is intended to help with BIG
     systems, but it isn't needed until you get REALLY BIG systems.
     
     Baseline Document XCOM03.Z01 states (Section B.3, page 2):
        "Switch BIGIO will effect the memory requirements of
        the interface.  When ON more memory will be required.
        An assembly time warning message will indicate when it
        must be turned ON."

     What happens if your system is TOO BIG?
     At the start of assembly of XCOM03.R01, a WARNING message will
     appear:

        "Configuration too large -- reduce either number of links, 
        MAXPSIZE, or MAXK, or use 2[BIGIO in CMD file."

     What is TOO BIG?
     It is not possible to make a general statement because of the
     variety of parameters, but the following configuration was genned
     without assembly errors, and WITHOUT 2[BIGIO:.
          512 DPORTS
          4 HOSTS
          10 LINKS (10 had packet size 512, packet window size 127,
                    2 had large frame size - MAXK(127)).

     Because of the large number of DPORTS, P0SIZE had to be increased
     to 1000 (this was also true with 255 DPORTS).  
     The final size was 664d K-bytes of core.

     You will probably not need to worry about getting a 2[BIGIO 
     message for your usual systems, but watch for PATCH0 area 
     overflow with lots of DPORTS.

     DO NOT use 2[BIGIO unless you are told to--and even then consider
     reducing one of the three sensitive parameters:  number of links,
     MAXPSIZE, or MAXK.

                   DOCUMENTS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE

     COMMENT ON THE HELPFUL DOCUMENTS ON THE BASELINE DIRECTORY:
     Baseline Software Release Form XCOM03.X01, Software Release
     Description XCOM03.Y01, and Document Change Description 
     XCOM03.Z01, all mention supporting documentation on System 39.

     These will soon be available on another system.  Don't
     give up if you don't have access to System 39.

   IBM ABNORNAL DISCONNECT/SECURITY ISSUE
 
   IBM host application programs have no standardized  method of
   accepting an "abnormal disconnect" sequence and closing end users
   sessions. The open session issue exists any time you introduce
   "switching" into an IBM data communications environment.  This
   includes not only Tymnet and other VAN's but also IBM's own SNA
   Network Interconnect products. Tymnet's IBM Host Interfaces have
   the capability to notify the IBM host to close its session.
   Tymnet has been working with our customers and outside software
   vendors to find workable solutions to close host sessions and
   "clean up" data queues.

   THE ISSUE

   The possibility of one end user getting into another end users
   open IBM host session and/or one end user getting data that was
   meant for another end user.     
 
   Example 1 : User 1 does not log out of their CICS session but
   unplugs the modem instead.  Tymnet will cancel the circuit and
   may send a "notification" to the IBM host.  It is the CICS on the
   IBM host that is responsible for understanding the "notification"
   and closing the end users session.

   Example 2: User 1 does not log out of their IMS session but
   unplugs the modem instead.  Tymnet will cancel the circuit and
   may send a "notification" to the IBM host.  It would then be up
   to IMS application program to cleanup user 1's data que's.
   Instead IMS is designed to hold that data until that LU logs on
   again.  Since Tymnet "shares" LU's among multiple end users user
   1's data will end up in someone else hands.  This is considered
   an unacceptable security violation by many customers.
 
   Example 3 :  User 1 disconnects abnormally.  Tymnet sends nothing
   or something that the IBM host can not interpret as "close the LU
   session".  The next end user will get into the open host session
   and will have bypassed any host security logons and/or passwords.

   CONCLUSION

   Tymnet has worked closing with our customers to find solutions
   for these issues.  The following are technical discussions that
   describe how various Tymnet customer have implemented successful
   systems with various IBM host applications.

   The setting of the disconnect sequence must be done VERY
   CAREFULLY by someone who is intimately familiar with IBM link
   level protocols.  The improper setting of a disconnect could
   cause undesirable reactions from a host system.
 



   CICS--Abnormal Disconnect
 
   Bisync systems running CICS version 1.6 and lower.
 
   Most CICS systems will close a session upon an abnormal
   disconnect if they are sent a Sense and Status message.
   Tymnet's Bisync Host Interface version 7.05 has a patch avialable
   from HQTech that will send any Sense/Status code that the
   customer needs. The customers CICS systems programmer should
   check the CICS Terminal error program, Terminal control program
   and/or Node abnormal condition program to determine what
   Sense/Status code should be used at their installation.
 
   NOTE:  DETERMINING THE CORRECT SENSE/STATUS IS THE CUSOMTERS
   REPONSIBILITY.  TRYING TO GUESS CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS IN BISYNC
   SYSTEMS. WHILE THE MOST COMMONLY FOUND SENSE/STATUS IS `C240'
   OR`D240', CICS SYSTEM TABLES MUST BE CHECKED BY THE CUSTOMERS
   SYSTEMS PROGRAMER TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF THE SENSE/STATUS
   SELECTED.  THE SENSE/STATUS SHOULD ONLY CLOSE A SINGLE SESSION
   AND NOT BE SET TO DISCONNECT OTHER USERS OR BRING DOWN THE ENTIRE
   CICS APPLICATION.

   Other technical concerns:

       1. CICS Terminal Control Table--if users can not log on after
       an abnormal disconnect the customers CICS programmer needs to
       check the RELREQ parameter.  If it is not there or is 
       RELREQ=(no,no), which is the IBM default, you have found a
       problem.  The table must be regened with the second
       parameter set to yes.
 
       RELREQ=(no,yes) or RELREQ=(yes,yes) or RELREQ=(,yes)
    
       2.  The VTAM exit LOSTERM may also effect the
       processing of the disconnect sequence. LOSTERM is the VTAM
       exit responsible for interpret and processing the
       sense/status to the host application.

   If problems still exist RFI *** BSC

   SNA/SDLC CICS Systems
 
   When the host interface get the Zapper it will send a SNA/SDLC
   Terminate-Self command to the IBM host.  Although the TERM-SELF
   is not documented as a valid 3270 command it does work.  If a
   customer is still having problems have the customers systems
   programmer check:
 
 
       1. If users can not log on after an abnormal disconnect the
       customers CICS programmer needs to check the RELREQ parameter
       of the CICS TCT table.  If it is not there or is
       RELREQ=(no,no), which is the IBM default, you have found a
       problem.  The table must be regened with the second parameter
       set to yes.
 
       RELREQ=(no,yes) or RELREQ=(yes,yes)  or RELREQ=(,yes)  are
       the recommended parameters.

       2.  VTAM Logmode table--most systems use an "orderly
       termination" ;however, some may need "forced termination".
       In this case, byte 3 bit 2 of the TERM-SELF will need to be
       adjusted.

                        procedure to be executed at the PLU before
                        the session is deavtivated (this is the
                        default)

       3.  If the problem still exists RFI *** SNA for further
       assistance.
 
 
 
 
   TSO--Abnormal Disconnect
 
   Bisync systems running TSO 
 
   Most TSO systems will close a session upon an abnormal disconnect
   if they are sent a Sense/Status message. Tymnet's Bisync Host
   Interface version 7.05 has a patch avialable from HQTech that
   will send any Sense/Status code that the customer needs. The
   customers TSO systems programmer should check the TSO system
   tables to determine the proper code.

 
   Note:  The most commonly found default is `C240' but have
   customer check to be sure.

   Other technical concerns:

       1.  The VTAM paramenter LOSTERM may also effect the
       processing of the disconnect sequence.

 
       2.  If problems still exist RFI *** BSC

       2.  If the problem still exists RFI *** SNA for further
       assistance.
 
 
 
 
   VM--Abnormal disconnect
 
   Bisync systems running VM 
 
   Most VM systems will close a session upon an abnormal
   disconnect if they are sent a Sense and Status message.
   if they are sent a Sense/Status message. Tymnet's Bisync Host

       2.  If the problem still exists RFI *** SNA for further
       assistance.
 
 
 
 
   IMS--Abnormal Disconnect
 
   IMS is the most difficult of all the IBM applications to get
   cleaned up.  This is becuase IMS is designed to keep data in its
   queues even upon system failure--the least of which is a terminal
   abnormally disconnnecting from a session.   While Tymnet's IBM
   Bisync Host Interface has the flexibility to send various
   "disconnect indicators " to the IBM host it still remains the
   responsibility of the customer to have IBM host software that
   will dequeue data intended for the disconnected  session.
 
   Some Tymnet customer's have written their own VTAM
   resident "session manager" software to perform this function.
   This software recognizes a message or status or test request
   sequence from the BSC HIF which indicates a network disconnect
   has taken place.  The SNA/SDLC HIF uses the TERM-SELF as the
   network "disconnect indicator". The software then cleans up any
   data left for the disconnected session. 

   At the present time, we are working with several software
   vendors and testing several packages that  perform the "clean-up"
   function.
 
   Another option to consider is to use static network addressing
