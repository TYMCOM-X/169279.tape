      IT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED, THAT AN UNDOCUMENTED AJ4048 DESIGN CAN ADVERSLEY
   AFFECT THE OPERATION/QUALITY OF THIS DIAL-UP SERVICE.  A 70 MILLI-SECOND
   LOSS OF CARRIER OR GAIN HIT AND RESULTANT WAIT PERIOD FOR A LOOP BACK OR
   DIAGNOSTIC COMMAND WILL DISCONNECT THE LINE.  IN THE DIAL-UP, VOICE QUALITY
   ENVIRONMENT, WE WILL EXPERIENCE CARRIER LOSSES OF THIS DURATION AND THE
   LINE WILL DROP AS THE APPROPRIATE REMOTE COMMAND DID NOT FOLLOW THE 70 
   MILLI-SECOND OPEN.

      AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED A MODIFIED P.R.O.M. TO THREE 
   CUSTOMER SITES.  THIS P.R.O.M. DEFEATS THE 70 MIL-SECOND WAIT PERIOD AND
   WILL ALLOW AN OPEN OF UP TO 10 SECONDS BEFORE THE LINE WILL DROP.  ALL 
   THREE APPLICATIONS WERE EXPERIENCING 3-8 LINE DROPS PER DAY.  WITH THE 
   INSTALLATION OF THE MODIFIED P.R.O.M.S THERE HAVE BEEN ZERO DROPS IN THE
   PAST 2-3 WEEKS.

      A.J.'S ENGINEERING GROUP IS LOOKING AT THE 70 MILLI-SECOND PERIOD TO 5
   SECONDS AND RETAINING THE REMOTE LOOP BACK/DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITY. 
   OBVIOUSLY, WE WOULD LIKE TO RETAIN THESE CAPABILITIES BUT, WILL FOREGO 
   THESE FEATURES IN FAVOR OF RESOLVING THE DICONNECT ISSUE IF IT IS NOT
   POSSIBLE.

      WE WILL BE UPGRADING ALL AJ MODEMS WITH THE NEW P.R.O.M.S AND REQUEST 
   YOU NOTIFY NTS IF YOU REQUIRE AN EXPEDITE ON AN UPGRADE.  A.C.F.B. WILL BE
   GENERATED WHICH WILL COVER ALL ASPECTS OF THE UPGRADE.

      I have been asked to outline for you the backup procedures currently
   in place at the data centers to better help you plan how and when you
   should specifically ask to have .NIB files backed to tape.  

   These procedures are consistent for all systems/all data centers:

   1)  Once a day a tape is generated for each system.  This captures
       all files created that day, and all updates to old files.
       These tapes are kept for one month.  (E.G., each system has
       a set of 31 tapes; one for each day of the month.  As the
       new month begins, tapes from the beginning of the previous
       month are over-written).

   2)  Every other week a procedure called 'ALLFILES' is done which
       copies every file on the system.  These tapes are kept for
       6 months.


      If you do not specifically request to have a file (or files) stored
   to tape be sure that its contents was at least captured by the daily
   tape backup before you delete it (i.e., keep it online 24-hours ).

      When requesting a file restoration, request that the file be restored
   from the ALLFILES tape which covered the date (or range of dates) in
   question.

                              POLICY ON PATCHES

Written by : Mike Cady, Director of Marketing
      Date : January 27, 1986




      A primary responsibility of both Technical Services and Network 
   Technology Development is to resolve software anomalies.  One of the 
   methods used to resolve an ananomaly includes the generation of a temporary
   patch.  As Technical Services does not have responsibility for either 
   source code or maintenance programming, the major decisions relating to the
   methodology of a cure lies with the Network Technology Division (NTD).  As
   a result, a close working relationship with NTD is required. This memo 
   attempts to set out the policy by which Technical Services and NTD will
   deal with the broad issue of patches.
 
      While Technical Services may be able to write a patch for a specific 
   customer need, their major responsibility is to ensure that NTD incorpor-
   ates the change not only in the version which demonstrates the problem/
   need, but all future product release.
 
      Software patches can be divided into two categories.  Those required to
   resolve an anomaly in the software and those required to implement a 
   feature not in the software.
 
   
      I. Patches created as the result of a software anomaly are    
         considered as a necessary element of the Field and 
         Technical Services function.  The following procedures 
         apply:
 

         A. All patches will undergo as much testing as possible 
            prior to installation in a network interface.
 
         B. All patches generated by the Field or Technical Services 
            must be delivered to NTD via the NSR process as an 
            anomaly report.
 
         C. Technical Services will support and maintain all patches 
            in an "ALPHA PATCH FILE" directory until NTD issues a 
            new PATCH FILE release.
 
         D. NTD will incorporate the fix in the next release of 
            source software whenever timing allows.
 
         E. NTD reserves the right to reject an NSR or Escalation 
            of a problem with an accompaning patch which has not 
            been approved by NTD when NTD suspects the ananomaly 
            is associated with the patch.
 

     II. Feature required as the result of a Field/customer request 
         must be submitted to Technical Services for review and are 
         not to be installed into a network interface without the 
         explicit consent of Technical Services.  The following 
         procedures apply:
                  

         A. All requests for features submitted to Technical 
            Services will be submitted to NTD and Product Marketing 
            via the PIR process.
 
         B. All feature patches generated by the Field or Technical 
            Services will be supported and maintained by Technical 
            Services in the ALPHA PATCH FILE directory until NTD 
            accepts or rejects the PIR.  Technical Services will, if 
            possible,  obtain PIR approval from NTD prior  to 
            installing a feature patch into a network interface.
 
         C. All feature patches installed into a network interface 
            which do not have NTD approval will require a letter 
            from Sales to the customer informing them of the special 
            nature of the patch and its possible removal in the 
            event of the PIR's rejection.
 
         D. All feature patches must be tested in a lab environment, 
            if at all possible, prior to installation.
 
         E. Upon acceptance of the PIR NTD will evaluate the 
            request and implement the feature in the next possible
            release of source software, as dictated by its priority
            as set by the JPPC.  NTD may reject an associated patch
            that it feels is not technically sound.  NTD's primary
            commitment is the implementation of features into the 
            source code, not via patches.

         F. PIR's and feature patches rejected by NTD will be 
            escalated to the Vice Presidents of Marketing and NTD 
            for resolution.  In the event that the PIR is found 
            unacceptable the customer will be notified via a letter 
            from Sales representative and the feature patch will be 
            de-installed.

     PROBE Log message:

     "NODE REPORT 2021 FROM SLOT 2 XCOM TYPE 1 10100" is defined in Steven 
     Wong's book, "A Presentation of CCITT Series X Recommendations and 
     Tymnet", pages 16.1-16.2 as:

     Interface Crash Sup Report with Crash Count 01, Crash Code 01 and 00
     as undefined.

     This is the normal state after starting up--Crash Code 01 is for manual
     start.  You should see it only after loading the code.

     This book also lists another Message Type that is not listed in the
     PROBE manual:  Type 0 - BUFFER ZAP SUP REPORT.  This report is made 
     whenever a Buffer Zap occurs.  (During the regular reporting routine, 
     Message Type 18 will be sent since the total number of buffer zaps has 
     changed since the last report to the Supervisor.

     The format for this Type 0 message is:

          NODE REPORT nnnn FROM SLOT m XCOM TYPE 0 aabbbb
          where aa = total number of 1 K characters deleted
                     i.e. 05 = 5000 characters deleted
                bbbb = buffer number zapped

     The messages listed in the PROBE manual (pages 73-80) give the value in
     an error cell  and are reported on a timer basis if the value in the 
     error cell has changed since the last report.  Message type 0 and message
     type 1 are reported as the event occurs.

      Good News!! The technical problems holding up the use of Concord Modems
   and Microsoft's Access with X.PC/CMT have been resolved.


   Microsoft's ACCESS
   ------------------

      If you have the Access software and have sent in your registration card
   to Microsoft they will be sending you information about upgrading to 
   Version 1.1.  This version (1.1) of Access has the latest version of X.PC.
   The new version is REQUIRED to operate X.PC/CMT correctly.  The previous 
   version of Access (1.0) will have problems with local echo mode of CMT.  If
   you have Access and have not returned your registration card to Microsoft 
   you should do or call Microsoft at (206) 828-8080 for information on ACCESS
   upgrades.


   Concord Modems
   --------------

      The Concord X.PC modems are O.K. if you received them after mid-December
   1985.  If you want to test before you do a live demo log in to the 3270 
   demo system via X.PC.  Use the Order Entry Screen (Option 4) and make sure
   you get into local echo mode within 2-3 seconds.  If it takes longer you 
   have a modem that needs upgrading.  You should contact your Concord rep to
   get modem updated.

      Remember, the X.PC Network Server is in Beta so using X.PC Network 
   Server by our customers still requires beta test approval.  You can make 
   your request via Ontyme by executing ":EXEC *** FORMS.XPCBETA."

      The X.PC Driver in the Concord modems and in the Microsoft's ACCESS is 
   in full release.  The products have been verified by HQ Quality Assurance.

      Happy Selling Async-to-3270 Service.  Now with complete end-to-end error
   correction via inexpensive async connections through X.PC!

                   DEDICATED ASYNC OUTDIAL  -  RELEASE II
                   --------------------------------------

      We are looking for a few good beta test customers to test Dedicated
   Outdial - Release II.

   The primary new features of Release II  are:

     1) Indial/Outdial  - the same port can be used for either indial or
        outdial on a demand basis.  For example, customers can use this 
        capability to implement security-call-back (i.e., end-users would 
        dialup Tymnet, login to the customers host in the usual way, identify
        themselves to the host by entering some username/password id, and then
        hang up.  The host would then initiate an outdial call back to the end
        -user, using the same indial/outdial port(s), to make sure they are 
        who they claim to be.   This application, of course, requires that 
        customers develop the call-back software on their host.)

     2) 2400 bps, as well as 1200 bps and 300 bps, async support for both 
        indial and outdial.

     3) Autobaud.  The Tymnet outdial port will automatically adjust to the
        speed of the device (modem) being outdialed to, and to the speed of   
        devices (modems) indialing to it.

     4) Dynamic option selection.  Parameters such as XON/XOFF, half duplex, 
        and parity can be set for each session at the beginning of the session

     5) Local echo.  Outdial calls originated by X.25 hosts support local 
        echoing at the Consat/Outdial interface.  (Consat originated outdial 
        calls, though, will not support local echoing at either end.)



      We are looking for 4 or 5 customers to begin testing in late March and 
   April.  The beta test should last approximately three months.

   To submit a request, send me an Ontyme (NSMS.G/Smith) with the following
   info:

   1. Business case.  What is the business (money) opportunity involved?

   2. Suitability as a beta site.  Will they be a productive test site?  Do 
      they have the necessary technical expertise and commitment?

   3. Application.  What are they going to use outdial for?

   4. Customer equipment.  What kinds of devices do they plan to use, e.g.,
      modems, host interface, printers, PCs, CRTs, etc.

   5. When will they be ready to start testing?




   KEY THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

   * Dedicated Outdial - Release II uses the new Consat/Outdial code developed
     for Publicly Shared Outdial which will be released later this year.  This 
     future service will allow customers to share outdial ports and be billed
     for their use of the ports on a usage sensitive basis.  Customers who are
     interested in using Public Outdial will clearly benefit from the experi-
     ence they gain with Dedicated Outdial - Release II.  Their efforts will 
     also help us to deploy Public Outdial sooner.

   * Dedicated Outdial - Release II uses a new command language.  Preliminary
     user documentation will be available in early March.  The old "Asynch-
     ronous Outdial User's Guide" is for the old Dedicated Outdial service 
     only.

   * The new Consat/Outdial code will undergo a month of internal QA tests 
     at HQ QA and NTS before the customer beta tests begin.

   * Beta Test Pricing.  For the beta test period, AOS-H1 monthly and install-
     ation charges will be waived.  All other charges will be applied, e.g., 
     kchars, host interface, account charge, outdial phone call charges.

   * Please do not submit an order before your request has been approved.  The
     order will just be put on  hold and you will have very disagreeable 
     people to deal with.

   * Once the request is accepted, customers will need to sign the Beta Test
     Agreement.


      If you have further questions, please Ontyme (NSMS.G/Smith) or call
   (x5214).

      As you are probably know, Tymnet customers that wi access the
   U.S. from Alaska can do so through Alascom.  Alascom has been expanding its
   access locations (see below for updated list).  One IMPORTANT consideration
   you should know when informing your customers about these new location: the
   log in procedure is different from Tymnet in many cases.
 
      *  Login procedure for non-stat mux sites is the same as Tymnet
 
      *  Login procedure for stat mux sites (SM sites) is the following:
 
         1. Dial the Alascom number
         2. User will see 3 to 5 lines of "?"
         3. User should type two carriage returns and the terminal identifier.
            This should be done while the question marks are being printed.
            Alascom will continue to send the "?" until the 3 to 5 lines of
            "?" are printed.
         4. Alascom will prompt the user with a PLI.

     TMCS Initialization
     ===================

     Load TMDM nib file (file.ni#) into TMCS slot first.
     After the slot is loaded, log into the slot host with 
     username:host#;pswd<cr>, the screen displays:
     > 
     TMCS Disk Maintenance Program - Version 1.03 at mm/dd/yy time
     *  
     Please enter INITialize for disk initialization.
     "disk initialization succeeded."  would be displayed if there 
     is no problem on disk.
     Use "Quit" to log off from the slot.

     Then load TMCS nib file (file.n0#) into the slot.  
     After the slot is loaded, log into the slot host with
     username:host#;pswd<cr> to get into TMCS, then use
     username MASTER pswd MASTER for the second login.
     Once log into TMCS slot successfully, first set up Probe
     circuit to each sup by using
     * SET PROBE sup#
     TMCS will prompt pswd, enter NETPAT's pswd.  If the
     pswd is not corrected, the Probe circuit will not be
     set.  
     After this, user can update TMCS database for user
     profile, node name, host name, host location, etc.


     NEM Initialization
     ==================

     Load NMDM nib file (file.ni#) into NME slot first.
     After the slot is loaded, log into the slot by using
     NETEVOP username (host# and pswd depends on how validation
     has been set up for NETEVOP).  The screen will displays:
     version #.## - date
     Enter command or "H" for help:
     For disk initialization, enter I, it will prompt
     Enter "A" for all sups, or last sup digit:  A (user enters)
     The "A" command will destroy all data on the disk,
     Do you want to continue?  Y (user enters)

     There is no log off command for NMDM, the slot will be
     replaced by loading NEM nib file (file.n0#) into it.
     After the slot is loaded, log into Probe to check
     whether the NEM host is up.  If it's up, then the
     loading is succeeded.  To try it works or not, log into
     TMCS using DISPLAY command.  


     Note:  When loading TMCS and NEM at the same time, both slots
     cannot be up due to synchronous problem.  For better result,
     load NEM slot first, after the slot is up, then load TMCS slot.

               HOW TO APPEND SYMBOL TABLE TO A SLOT DUMP FILE
               ----------------------------------------------
               ----------------------------------------------


Written by : Dianna Tai/DeeJong Tsao, HQ Network Staff Consultant    
      Date : February 26, 1986




      We have come across several occasions when the symbol tables were not
   appended to the dump files, or if it was appended, it was useless due to
   errors in the process.  Some probable errors might be:

 
   1. Error occurred in one of the following steps:
 
      a. Named the dump file with the nib file name. 
      b. Appended wrong nib file to the dump file; for example, appended
         SNA nib file to 3270 HIF dump.
      c. Used a new dump file name (different from the dump file name
         created via LOADII) while appending the dump to the nib file.
 
   2. The slot crashes; NSSC takes the dump and then notifies the CC.  

      This results in a complicated situation in which the dump file and nib
      file reside on different systems/different directories.  Now, the
      TELECOPY program is used to copy one file from a particular directory
      and system, onto another.  

      If difficulty encountered, cc may leave this task to Technical Servces

 
      Following, are examples of steps you would use in taking a slot dump 
   and appending the symbol table correctly:  (note: lower case letters are 
   system prompts) 
 
   Step 1. Run LOADII to take a slot dump (only input the related prompts
           which are displayed here) 
 
           -R LOADII 
           enter function:U
           enter kernel host number:666
           circuit built
           enter slot number:2
           enter file for slot:NDXXX.DMP
           ....
           ....
           slot dump complete
           exit
 
   (Now you have created a file called NDXXX.DMP, which is a dump file
   from slot #2, on kernel host 666).
 
   Step 2. Check to see if the nib file is on the same directory and same 
           system.  Let's assume dump file NDXXX.DMP is in (NSSC:26), and 
           nib file ND1234.N02 exists on (TYMNET:54).  You decide to put
           them both on (TYMNET:54) and use TELECOPY to copy the dump file
           to (TYMNET:54) where the nib file is located.
 
           a. log on to (NSSC:26) with your license set
           b. -COPY NDXXX.DMP,(TYMNET)NDXXX.DMP
           c. -R TELECOPY
              :(TYMNET:26)NDXXX.DMP,(TYMNET:54)NDXXX.DMP
           d. -DEL (TYMNET)NDXXX.DMP
 
      (TYMNET:26) is used as a transitional station to get around TELECOPY
      limitations, as it only copies files from same directory to different
      system.  Thus, it is necessary to delete NDXXX.DMP from (TYMNET:26) 
      after the file is copied successfully.)
 
   Step 3. Now, you can append the symbol table by logging on to (TYMNET:54),
           where you have both files ready.
 
           -R NAD
           %F    ND1234.N02      (note, the spaces are given by NAD)
           %G
           1%F    NDXXX.DMP
           %P%Q
           -
 
           (This NDXXX.DMP now should have symbol table appended)
 
 
   Step 4. To verify if the symbol table is appended and you have a valid
           dump, examine the dump file:
 
           -R NAD
           %F    NDXXX.DMP
           %G
           (case A: here if you get "Module not in file", then symbol
                    table is not appended)
           ;G
           (you will get segments range display)
           8%2
           PRODID#
           (case B: if get "Undefined not allowed?", then dump got messed-up
                    somewhere)
           (case C: if it is a 3270 HIF dump, and you got a number other than
                    34 from the system, then the nib file must be from 
                    another slot / another product)
           CRAT,4C[
           (case D: IF this is a crash dump, but crash table contains 0's,
                    then you did not catch the crash information.)
         
      When any of these cases (A,B,C or D) are encountered, the dump file is
   not valid and will not be useful for analysis.

      Lately, there has been some confusion regarding the charging for 
   CMT/3270 services, when CMT and 3270HIF slots are running in different 
   nodes.  This memo serves to clarify the issue.  

      Currently there are two ways in which Tymnet charges for CMT/3270HIF 
   services.  The details are listed below :

   1) CMT/3270 service charged by one session ---
      This applies to the following 2 network configurations :
      a) CMT and 3270 residing in the same node, or
      b) CMT and 3270 slots residing in the same site but on different nodes.

   Either of the above configurations generates one invoice number for the
   session between CONSAT and CMT, and it is the only session charged by
   TYMNET.

   2) CMT/3270 service charged by two sessions ---
      If CMT and 3270 slots are seperated at different sites and nodes, then
      two invoice numbers are produced: one for the session between CONSAT
      and CMT, and the other one for the session between CMT and 3270HIF. 
      In this case, both sessions are charged by TYMNET.

           Security Implications of Gateway Access Procedures 	  
           --------------------------------------------------
           --------------------------------------------------


Written by :   Stephen White, External Network Services
      Date :   February, 1986



   Here follows a discussion of some alternative procedures by which
   Tymnet may be accessed from 'foreign' networks.  Emphasis is given to
   the security offered by Tymnet's advanced implementation of X.121
   addressing.
 
   For the purposes of this discussion a 'foreign' network is any
   network other than Tymnet and includes not only other country's
   networks but also other networks in the United States of America.
   Network security from gateways is increasingly important as Tymnet
   brings up X.75 service with the Bell Operating Companies:  over 160
   such gateways are already planned.  Tracing 'hacker' calls back
   through gateways is time-consuming and often fruitless.  
 
   A host may elect to be open to calls worldwide or to restrict access
   by requiring a username and/or password to be given to Tymnet before
   the call is routed to their host.  Tymnet addressing also allows for
   an address to be priority and/or multi-targeted to a group of hosts.
   The wide range of options available enable a host to tailor its
   access procedures to satisfy its requirements for security and ease
   of access.
 
   Tymnet's security is at its weakest at the x.75 gateways where we
   have to conform to the CCITT standards used by networks worldwide.
   The spirit of the CCITT standards x.121 and x.75 is that, as with the
   telephone, if you know a number you may call it.  For hosts that wish
   this we provide group 19 (see below).  Tymnet is unique in the level
   of security it can provide through enhanced features like those
   outlined below.  In these matters prevention is definitely better
   than cure, we urge careful reading of this document so that
   a full appreciation of the implications of each alternative may be
   gained....do you know that, by default, domestic usernames can
   be used to log in from foreign nets?...read on!
 
 
 
 
   OPEN GATEWAY ACCESS - Group 19 
   ------------------------------

   Hosts which wish to be addressable from any foreign network with
   Tymnet connections and with minimal network security applied may
   request (preferably as a written request) to be in group 19.
 
   A host in group 19 is presumed to have security checks performed by
   the host operating system.  Group 19 host addresses are available to
   foreign administrations so a host that does not wish its address to
   be so widely available should request to be red-listed (un-published).

A group 19 host is addressable as....(note the zero after the 3106)..
 
3106+0+<host>+<spid>   where:  3106    = Tymnet's Data Network Identification
                                         code (DNIC) allocated to Tymnet by
                                         the U.S. State Department.
                                 0     = 'identifier' digit.
                               <host>  = a 5 digit host number.
                               <spid>  = up to a 4 digit sub-addr (optional).
 
Example: 3106000127  would address host 127, with no sub-host.

Easy Access - no password to enter.     Address may become known to
                                        non-legitimate users, 'hackers'.
 
Wide range of sub-hosts addresses.
 
Worldwide access.                       Access cannot be limited from 
                                        particular countries.
 
                                        no priority/multi targetting
                                        capability.
 
 
 
ALTERNATIVES TO GROUP 19
------------------------
   To take advantage of Tymnet's security checking capabilities on calls
   from other networks a host needs one of the alternatives to group 19
   for its access procedures.  Using one (or more) of the options below,
   with password protection, a very effective initial screening of calls
   is carried out by the network supervisor.  Note that for a host
   migrating from group 19 it is not necessary to change the host
   number, moreover the X.121 address that is sent to the host may not
   need to be changed.
 
 
   Suppose host 0127 wishes to be removed from group 19, or set up for
   restricted gateway access:  the options are...
 
OPTION (A) - Using a Network User Number (NUN) with password protection.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Send a request to ENS.DTE for a numeric username as an NUN to form
   the x.121 address.  We recommend that a password and red-listing
   (address un-published) be requested though these items are optional.
   Addresses in this format are of the form...(note the 9 after the
   DNIC)...
 
3106+9+<host>+<spid>   where:  3106   = Tymnet's DNIC
                                 9    = 'identifier' digit
                              <host>  = a 5 digit hostnumber
                              <spid>  = up to 4 digits of sub-addr (optional).
 
   Example:  For host 127, sub-host 00...
             310690012700    (NUN=90012700)
             310690012700    (NUN=90012700)
 
 
Note:  If a password  is required  then the Tymnet supervisor will prompt
       for the password before the circuit is built to the host.  With the
       address being a username, a password may be added/changed by the host
       at any time, even if no password was originally requested.  Password
       changes take effect in about 20 minutes - considerably quicker than
       removing the host from group 19 and validating an NUN!

                                        hence a password is recommended.
 
Multi/Priority targetting.              Sub-host addressing is awkward with
                                        current implementation, a separate
                                        NUN is required for each sub-host.
                                        A version of XCOM code will soon be
                                        available to overcome this limitation.
 
By addressing 31249.... instead of      DNIC 3124 can only be used from those
31069.... access may be limited to      countries served by FTCC.   In the
particular international links.         event of an outage at FTCC, backup 
                                        facilities may be limited and access
                                        temporarily lost from affected links.
                                        Links may serve more than one network.
 
Note:  For X.25  hosts,  be sure   to  coordinate  the  change of called
       address with the  host. If it is difficult for the host to change
       its software to accept a new called address it may be possible to
       perform address modification at the host interface to overcome this.
 
       Example:  for a version 3.01 X.25 host a patch, (bchen:33)caddr.301,
       may be included which will ALWAYS substitute the called
       address in an IIX call for the address specified in the CLDADR
       statement.  Other patches, capable of more elaborate
       manipulation, may be available, contact HQTECH XCOM group or
       ExNet Tech Spt (ENS.ITS) for information.
 
OPTION (B) - Using a Random Network User Number with password protection.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Request  a random NUN  (from  ENS.DTE) for  the x.121 address, ask for it
to be red-listed (un-published) and have a password.
 
 
 
 
Addresses of this format are of form...(note 99 after the DNIC)..
 
3106+99+<####>     where:  3106  = Tymnet's DNIC
                            99   = 'identifier' digits
                          <####> = four to eight (4-8) 'random' digits.
 
Example: For host 127,  31069985326   (NUN=9985326)
 
Note:   If sub-host addressing   is required  then specify in the request
to ENS.DTE exactly  what  the  last   1-4   digits   should  be for every
sub-host.
 
Advantages and disadvantages of option (b)
------------------------------------------

   Same as for option (a) except that with the host number no longer in
   the address, problem diagnosis may be slowed:  the price for being
   cryptic.
 
 
OPTION (C) - The 'user friendly' approach.
------------------------------------------

   From a foreign network, users are able to enter a called address of
   "31069" to direct their call to Tymnet.  The Tymnet supervisor
   prompts them to "please log in:  "  just as on Tymnet.  If a class 1,
   2, 4 or 24 username is entered, the supervisor will allow the call to
   be completed.  By default ALL 'domestic' usernames have class 4
   access and may be used to log in from other networks.
 
   If you wish to control which usernames may be used from foreign
   networks, give 'domestic' usernames only class 35 access and
   'foreign' usernames only class 1 access.  A class 1 username MUST
   originate from an X.75 gateway host whereas a class 35 username is
   EXCLUDED from gateway access.  This provides good security, standard
   'log in' procedures and user friendly network responses.
 
Advantages                              Related disadvantages
----------                              ---------------------
Easy for async/3270 hosts that          More difficult for host 
need to 'key-off' usernames for         to originate calls.
sub-host/application routing.
                                        An X.25 Host recieves a call request
                                        with "31069" as the called address.
                                        This may be rejected by the host
                                        software, so it may be necessary to 
                                        have the host interface modify the
                                        address sent to the host.
User friendly network responses.
 
Username/password combination is
difficult to 'crack'.  Tymnet host
is able to change password for user.
 
Log in procedures are very similar
for both domestic and foreign users.
  
 
CONCLUSION
----------

   A requirement for 'external network' access is by no means synonymous
   with a host needing to be in group 19, with all the attendant
   security implications.  Choosing one of the alternative options, or a
   combination of (c) with (a) or (b), can offer effective protection
   and other benefits.
