Five-Digit Host Numbers Not Supported in SDLC 1.12 or SDLC 2.02

We have recently seen problems arising from the assignment of five-digit
host numbers to SDLC interfaces.  Currently available SDLC software
(versions 1.12 and 2.02) does not support host numbers exceeding four
digits in length.  This issue is currently being addressed by
Development.  The fix for this situation will be deployed in SDLC 2.04
which is now undergoing QA testing.
 
In the meantime, Project Implementation will cease issuing five-digit
host numbers to new SDLC installations.  Should you already have a
five-digit host number assigned for a pending installation, please
submit a request to have P.I.  reassign a four-digit host number for
that installation.

Error in SNA Version 3.03 Patch File            
 
A typographical error has been discovered in (BETATEST)SNA03.P03.  This
error will not generally cause problems if this is the only patch file
assembled, however the error may cause serious difficulties if other
patches are added into the gen.  The error will be corrected as soon as
possible - and certainly before the code is placed in the SOURCE
directory for its limited release.
 
In the meantime, if you must regen an SNA 3.03 interface, replace
(BETATEST)SNA03.P03 with (TECHSERV)SNA03.P03 when assembling the code.
The checksum for (TECHSERV)SNA03.P03 is QOCROF.
 
Following is a sample command file illustrating the change:

Crash Type 35 in version 7.04 of CMTI
     
CMT support has noticed a number of escalations for a crash type 35 in
version 7.04 of CMTI.  To help cut down on these escalations we want to
warn you about the changes necessary to fix the problem.  When customers
upgrade from version 3.00 to version 7.04 care should be taken to define
segment 5 in your commands file.  Version 7.04 has added this new
segment to hold error messages, if the segment is not genned in then any
attempt by the CMT to get an error message will cause this type of
crash.  Your version 7.04 commands file should look like this:

HP Spectrum Hosts 

If you connect an HP Spectrum Host Async into the Net, you need to do
the following:

HP port time is a DB20 modem port. 

In your Tymnet code, set PCAN and PSIG to SIG.

For cabling, leave the crossovers on. On a cable from the crossover to the
host: 
         
              Cross 2 and 3 back over - 2-3 and 3-2
              Jumper 4,6, and 8 to 20.

As a lot of you know, HP hosts can be frustrating to work with, so you
may want to add this to your HP file.

Tymnet X.28 PAD CUG Support Reference

The following is a quick reference to Tymnet X.28 PAD implementation of
CUG facility.  I would like to thank Stephen Liang for the great effort
that he put into this document, I hope that it will answer questions
regarding CUG.

Tymnet X.28 PAD Implementation Of CCITT Closed User Group Facility
 
I.  Introduction
 
Closed user group (CUG) is an optional user facility agreed for a period
of time.  This facility, if subscribed to, enables the start-stop DTE to
belong to one or more CUG(s).  A CUG permits the DTE(s) belonging to the
group to communicate with each other, but precludes communication with
all other DTE(s).
 
The calling start-stop DTE specifies the closed user group selected for
the call using the CUG facility parameters in the call selection
command.  The CUG selected for a virtual call will be indicated to a
called start-stop DTE using the same facility parameter in the incoming
call packet.  When a start-stop DTE only belongs to one closed user
group or when the call is associated with the DTE's preferential closed
user group, this indication may not be present.
 
Closed user group with subscriptions of outgoing/incoming access are
optional user facilities agreed for a period of time.  These facilities,
if subscribed to, enable the start-stop DTE to belong to one or more
closed user groups, to originate/receive calls in the open part of the
network.
 
II.  Tymnet X.28 PAD Implementation
 
The current Tymnet  X.28  PAD  implementation  of  Closed  User  Group
facility  does  not  fully  comply  with  CCITT  recommendations 1984, 1988
respectively. There are basically 12 types of CUG arrangement in respect to
1988 CCITT recommendation X.25 and X.301:
 
 1.  CUG
 2.  CUG/IA
 3.  CUG/OA
 4.  CUG/IA/OA
 5.  CUG/ICB
 6.  CUG/OCB
 7.  CUG/IA/ICB
 8.  CUG/IA/OCB
 9.  CUG/OA/ICB
10. CUG/OA/OCB
11. CUG/IA/ICB/OCB
12. CUG/OA/ICB/OCB
 
where    IA  - Subscribes with incoming access
         OA  - Subscribes with outgoing access
         ICB - Incoming call barred
         OCB - Outgoing call barred
 
The PAD currently does not support ICB and OCB CUG facilities.
Therefore, only items 1 to 4 above are applicable.
 
In the Tymnet X.28 PAD, the CCITT Closed User Group (d of 2 processes:
 
1.  CUG Access Subscription
2.  CUG Interclock Code Validation
 
A.  CUG Access Subscription
 
The user may apply the CUG facility by subscribing to CLOSED USER GROUP
during the system generation time (defined in Tymfile).  For example, to
enable the CUG facility the "CUG" macro is used.  Thus,
 
	The "CUG" macro:
 
	Description: defines the CLOSED USER GROUP facility switch options.
	Syntax:      CUG(submode,inmode,outmode,p0,...,pn)
	Default:     0 for above three
 
	submode      =  1  subscribed to CUG facility
	             =  0  not subscribed to CUG facility
	inmode       =  1  subscribed to CUG with incoming access
		     =  0  subscribed to CUG without incoming access
	outmode      =  1  subscribed to CUG with outgoing access
		     =  0  subscribed to CUG without outgoing access
 
If the user wants to use the CUG facility for a specific port, the CUG
facility must be subscribed for it.  The CUG subscription is done on a
port or a range of ports basis.
 
Currently the PAD takes no action on the INCOMING ACCESS subscription.
 
If a port has been subscribed to have the CUG facility with OUTGOING
ACCESS, the CUG facility is sent with CUG/OA selection facility
indication code.

If a port has been subscribed to have the CUG facility without OUTGOING
ACCESS, the CUG facility is sent with "CUG selection facility"
indication code.
 
B.   CUG Interlock Code Validation
 
The second process in the CONSAT/PAD which handles Closed User Group
facility deals with CUG Interlock Code Validation.  The CUG Interlock
Code can be considered as information for a specific "Closed User
Group", and this information is used by the remote host to verify the
validity of the call.
 
The Interlock Code for a "Closed User Group" is subscribed on a port or
a range of port basis.  However a port can be subscribed to more than
one Closed User Group(s).  Subscription to a specific Closed User Group
can be done by configuring the CUGROUP macro which is described below:
 
	Description: specifies the Interlock Code Mapping for each CUG index.
	Syntax:      CUGROUP(Index,icodea,icodeb,p0,p1,...,pn)
	Default:     none
 
	index        =  CUG index < 99 (decimal)
	icode        =  DNIC portion of the Interlock Code
		        (0 for national CUG, 2000-7999 for international CUGs)
	icode        =  the rest of the Interlock Code (decimal)
 
The user may use an index configured via CUGROUP macro for this port to
specify a CUG he/she wants to belong to during the call setup.
 
If the CUG index is being specified in the CUG facility field in the
call selection command, this index is used to map to a specific
Interlock Code for a specific Closed User Group.  The Interlock Code s
included in the Call Request packet as CUG facility to be sent to the
remote DCE.
 
If the user specifies a CUG INDEX which is not confileared and no call
request is sent out to the network.
 
It is only optional for the user to specify the CUG INDEX in the CUG
facility field during the call setup.  The user may configure the
preferential CLOSED USER GROUP (default CLOSED USER GROUP) on a port or
a range of ports basis.  Thus,
 
	Description: specifies the preferential CLOSED USER GROUP
	Syntax:      CUGPREF(index,p0,p1,...,pn)
	Default:     index = 0
 
If the user does not specify the CUG INDEX in the CUG facility field
then the preferential CUG index is used as the default CUG INDEX to
refer to the interlock code.
 
NOTE: X.25 and X.29 messages  are  exchanged  using  the Tymnet IIX message
      format within the Tymnet network. A typical example of CUG facility in
      a call request packet is shown below:
 
      (a) CUG Selection Facility:
 	  0AC0 8C07 06C3 0431 4630 39
 
      (b) CUG/OA Selection Facility:
          0AC0 8C07 06C7 0431 4630 39
 
      Interpretation:
 
      0A   - length of IIX message
      C08C - network utility
      07   - length of Network utility
      06   - length of CUG field
      C3   - CUG indication code - CUG selection facility
      C7   - CUG indication code - CUG/OA selection facility
      04   - length of interlock code
      3146 - the first part of interlock code - DNIC NO. (in decimal).
      3039 - the second part of interlock code - (in HEX)
