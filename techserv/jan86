                 DEPLOYING MULTI-TARGET HOSTS IN THE NETWORK

      When deploying multi-target hosts in the network, it should be ensured
   that only one host is assigned per node.  The Supervisor code is not 
   designed to handle two or more multi-target hosts on the same node.  If
   this happens, only one of the hosts will be considered (depending on the
   sequence of host numbers in the user profile) and the rest of the hosts, on
   the node, will be ignored.

   It should also be ensured that for the nodes on which the multi-target 
   hosts are based, the PTHRU (passthrough flag) parameter is not disabled,
   i.e., passthroughs should be allowed by turning PTHRU to zero.  This is a
   limitation in the current Supervisor.  The Supervisor calculates very high
   costs to destination nodes that are out of passthroughs.  As a result, no
   calls would be routed to hosts based on such nodes.  This limitation will 
   be removed from future Supervisor releases.  The code to handle this is
   curently being tested.

      In addition to the "Q" command not working, the Tymshare model 923 does
   not have the ability to accurately process (at its command level) a dial
   string coming from an X.75 gateway.  Two (2) VEN-TEL 212 PLUSII ver 2.20
   modems have been tested in this configuration and have passed.  (The "Q"
   command works on this model too).  If your customer is logging on through 
   an X.75 gateway and you are unable to install the VEN-TEL 212 PLUSII ver 
   2.20, I cautiously recommend pre-programming the dial string in the 
   Tymshare model 923's memory.  If you have any questions regarding this
   issue, please ontyme NSS.WING.

   Special Note - The Tymshare model 925, fitted with version 2.20 proms, is
   the equivalent to the VEN-TEL 212 PLUSII ver 2.20 modem.

      Async Outdial Service is becoming a more popular project.  I have
   noticed, though, that Communication Consultants and Field Engineers have
   not been briefed on how this service works.  Implementation of this
   service has been confused.  Allow me to propose a couple tips so that you
   do not get caught by surprise.

   1)  All field offices should have received a bundle of "Asynchronous Out-
       dial User's Guide" pamphlets.  If your office has not received any, or
       has run out, you can order more through publications.  Reading this
       guide, is an excellent orientation to the product and a handy reference
       guide.

   2)  There are a couple of Outdial demo slots that you can log into to get a
       feel of how the product works.  The username is 'OUTDIALDEMO', the host
       numbers are 7015, 7017, or 7019, and the password is 'demo'.  If you
       get a 'host out of ports' message, try another host or try again in a
       couple minutes since there is only one port available per slot at this
       time.

       When you make a successful connection, type a 'H' for help at the '$'
       prompt.  A list of modem commands will be displayed.  Enter the nearest
       local access number and dial it.  For Newport Beach (host 7015) use
       7568341.  For New York (host 7017) use 6898850.  For Valley Forge (host
       7019) use 6669190.  When you receive the "ONLINE!" banner from the 
       modem and the network "please type your terminal identifier" message,
       logon to a Tymnet PDP10 system to simulate a completed call.  Please
       remember to logoff so that the port will be available for others to
       use.

   3)  For generating code, there are files on systems 33 and 70 in the 
       techserv directory that you can refer to.  They are OTDIAL.DOC,
       SAMPLE.T01, OTDIAL.T01, GENOTD.DOC, and OTDIAL.C01.

            PUBLIC NETWORK CODE MANAGEMENT - NEW BACKUP PROCEDURE

      THIS WEEKEND (DECEMBER 13 - 15), WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THE MOVE OVER 
   TO FOUR (4) PUBLIC NETWORK CODE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.  PLEASE NOTE THE 
   FOLLOWING:


   DIRECTORY                (TYMNET)                   (TYM4000)
                            nodes less than 4000       nodes 4000 and above


   PRIMARY SYSTEM/          25 - DALLAS KL             54 - DALLAS KL
   LOADING SYSTEM

   BACKUP SYSTEM            70 - CUPERTINO KI          33 - CUPERTINO KL


   IN PREPARATION FOR THE MOVE, REGIONAL DIRECTORIES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED
   AS PER THE NEW BACKUP PROCEDURES.  THEY WILL BE UTILIZED AS FOLLOWS:


   REGION                      REGIONAL DIRECTORY          CONTACT
   ------                      -------- ---------          -------

   WEST                        CENTCODE                    DEE HALBROOK
   WEST                        WATECH                      KUSHI KULLAR
   EAST                        (UNAVAILABLE)               CLAIR STAUFFER
   EXTERNAL NETWORK TECH       INTLTECH                    JEFF OLIVETO


   AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE, PER EILEEN RIORDAN'S RECENT MEMO, ALL REGIONAL 
   DIRECTORIES ARE VALIDATED ON ALL (4) SYSTEMS.  THE COMMUNICATIONS 
   CONSULTANT WILL PLACE THEIR SLOT CODE FROM THEIR PERSONAL DIRECTORIES INTO
   THE REGIONAL DIRECTORY ON THE CORRECT SYSTEM (25 OR 54) DEPENDING ON THE 
   NODE NUMBER.  CODE GENERATION WILL THEN RENAME THE CODE FROM THE REGIONAL
   DIRECTORY INTO THE TYMNET OR TYM4000 DIRECTORY UPON RECEIPT OF A BACKUP 
   REQUEST.  A GENERIC SKELETON FOR BACKUP REQUESTS IS LOCATED ON (TYMNET:25)
   BACKUP.SKL.  PLEASE ENSURE THAT ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IS COMPLETE AND 
   ACCURATE.  ANY BACKUP REQUESTS SENT TO THE WRONG SYSTEM, i.e., backup for 
   node 4500 on system 25, WILL BE REJECTED.  I REALIZE THAT SOME OF YOU MAY 
   HAVE YOUR OWN BACKUP SKELETONS ALREADY.  PLEASE CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THEM IF
   THEY ARE FOR YOUR BENEFIT, JUST BE SURE THEY INCLUDE ALL INFORMATION 
   REQUESTED IN THE GENERIC SKELETON.

   LAST, A SIMPLE MERLIN PROGRAM WILL BE RUN BY THE CODE GENERATOR TO BIND THE
   SLOT CODE WITH THE NODE CODE.  THE COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT WILL BE 
   NOTIFIED VIA THE BACKUP SUMMARY REPORT THAT THEIR BACKUP IS COMPLETE.  WITH 
   THE (4) SYSTEMS IN PLACE, I AM OPTIMISTIC AT COMPLETING BACKUP REQUESTS
   WITHIN (24) HOURS ON THE PRIMARY/LOADING SYSTEMS AND (48) HOURS ON THE 
   PUBLIC NETWORK BACKUP SYSTEMS.

   FOR A SMOOTH TRANSITION, I AM REQUESTING THAT THE FIELD SUBMIT BACKUP 
   REQUESTS THE 'OLD WAY' THRU WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11.  AS OF THURSDAY, 
   DECEMBER 12, ANY BACKUPS SENT TO TYMOPS.BACKUP SHOULD BE SENT TO THE 
   CORRECT SYSTEM (AS SPECIFIED ABOVE).  ALL BACKUPS SENT THURSDAY AND FRIDAY
   (DECEMBER 12 - 13) WILL BE PROCESSED ON THE NEW SYSTEMS MONDAY, DEC 16.  
   THE TIMING IS CRUCIAL TO MEET THE BATCH REQUESTS WE ARE SUBMITTING ON 
   FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13.  YOUR COOPERATION WILL BE MUCH APPRECIATED.  

   AT THIS TIME, IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO ASK THE COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT TO 
   HAVE THEIR CODE AVAILABLE AT TIME OF INSTALL.  GENERAL CONSENSUS FROM THE 
   FIELD IS THAT SLOT CODE IS UNIQUE TO EACH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER GIVEN THE 
   VARIOUS OPTIONS, THUS ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THE SLOT CODE AFTER THE INSTALL
   IS NOT UNUSUAL.  THIS TOPIC MAY BE PURSUED AT A LATER DATE.

   PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL ME AT (408)942-5180 IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER
   QUESTIONS.  REVISED CODE GENERATION PROCEDURES WILL BE RELEASED AFTER THE
   MOVE HAS BEEN COMPLETED.  

   HERE'S TO SYSTEM AVAILABILITY AND IMPROVED RESPONSE TIME.  THANK YOU FOR
   YOUR COOPERATION AND CONTINUED SUPPORT.

      I have released a temp patch, DSPHIF.PAT, which is used to fix DSP out 
   of sequence problem (in CMT, you see HOST ERROR CODE 2) for PBH 7.02/7.03.
   The formal patch has been released to SOURCE p00 file. Please remove
   DSPHIF.PAT from your command file and regen your code with the new release.
   Do it ASAP especially if you have native mode or CMT customers. Thanks.

 

   The following tables are the results from running BETATEST version 2.06 
   that show the size of core memory needed to run 3270 CMT with different
   combinations of devices attached to the network.

   To use the table, go to the table with the number of terminal type
   (DEFTRM=1,10,19) that you have selected that can be used to the network.
   The columns of the table select the printer attached to the network and the
   rows select the ter users.  The intersection of PR USER and CRT USER 
   is the size in decimal kilobytes of core memory needed to run 3270 CMT 
   interface.

Written by : Ping Chu, HQ Network Staff Consultant
      Date : JULY 25, 1985
 
 
 
 
      THIS MEMO SERVES TO INFORM YOU THAT OUR SDLC INTERFACES DO NOT ZAP
   THE PERMANENT VIRTUAL CIRCUIT (PVC) FOR NO REASONS.  WHEN YOU NOTICE THE
   CIRCUIT ZAPPED MESSAGE IN USING THE LOGTABLE COMMAND OF THE SDLC MONITOR, 
   IT MAY BE ISSUED FOR ANY ONE OF THE REASONS:
 
 
 
      UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES, THE  SDLC  INTERFACE WILL SEND AN
   ISIS MESSAGE "9E" DETACH TO DETACH A PERMANENT VIRTUAL CIRCUIT.
 
 
          1.  THE DSR SIGNAL DROPPED ON THE LINE BETWEEN FRONT END 
              PROCESSOR AND THE SDLC HOST INTERFACE.
 
          2.  A MONITOR USER ENTERED THE SHUT COMMAND FOR  A  SPECIFIC
              STATION  VIA  THE MONITOR HOST CO-RESIDING WITH THE SDLC
              HOST INTERFACE.
 
          3.  A MONIOTR USER ENTERED THE SHUT COMMAND TO SHUT THE HOST
              LINE VIA THE MONITOR HOST CO-RESIDING WITH THE SDLC HOST
              INTERFACE.
 
          4.  THE SDLC HOST INTERFACE HAS USED UP  ALL  ITS  AVAILABLE
              PORTS  AND  REPORTS  THE HOST OUT OF PORT MESSAGE TO THE
              SUPERVISOR.  THE HOST INTERFACE WILL NOT HONOR  ANY  NEW
              NEEDLE  REQUESTS  AND  IT  SHALL  DETACH THE NEW CIRCUIT
              WHICH EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE NEW NEEDLE REQUEST.
 
          5.  THE SDLC HOST INTERFACE SENDS THE SELECT DIALECT COMMAND
              -  8080, BUT THE SELECT DIALECT RESPONSE - 8081 DOES NOT
              COME BACK  FROM  THE  TERMINAL  INTERFACE  TO  THE  HOST
              INTERFACE  IN  TIME.  THE HOST INTERFACE WILL NOT ACCEPT
              THIS USER'S NEEDLE REQUEST.  IT WOULD ALSO  DETACH  THIS
              CIRCUIT.
 
          6.  WHEN THE HOST  INTERFACE  RECEIVES  A  ZAPPER  FROM  THE
              NETWORK,  IT  WILL UNCONDITIONALLY SEND A DETACH MESSAGE
              FOR THIS CIRCUIT.
 
          7.  WHEN THE HOST INTERFACE RECEIVES A "C089" CALL USER DATA
              AND  IT  FINDS  OUT THAT THE CONTROL UNIT'S ADDRESS DOES
              NOT MATCH WITH THE PU ADDRESS GENED IN THE TYMFILE.
 
          8.  THE USER TRIES TO LOGON TO THE MONITOR HOST, BUT HIS/HER
              NAME IS NOT ON THE GOODGUY LIST GENED IN THE TYMFILE.
 
          9.  THE SECOND TIME THE USER USES THE SAME USERNAME TO LOGON
              TO  THE  MONITOR  HOST  WHILE THE FIRST CIRCUIT IS STILL
              INTACT.  THE INTERFACE  WILL  DETACH  THE  SECOND  LOGON
              REQUEST.
 
         10.  THE USER LOGS OFF THE MONITOR HOST  BY  TYPING  EXIT  OR
              BYE.  THIS WILL CAUSE THE CIRCUIT BEING DETACHED.
 
         11.  UPON RECEIPT OF AN ISIS MESSAGE "AE" BREAK (SUCH AS  THE
              MONITOR  DEVICE  GETS  POWERED OFF ALL OF A SUDDEN), THE
              INTERFACE WILL DETACH THIS CIRCUIT.
 
 
 
      UNDER THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS THE SDLC INTERFACE  WILL SEND AN ISIS
   MESSAGE "9F" ZAPPER TO ZAP A PERMANENT VIRTUAL CIRCUIT.
 
 
          1.  AT THE INTIALIZATION TIME, THE INTERFACES CLEAR OUT  ALL
              THE ACTIVE CIRCUITS.
 
          2.  WHEN THE SDLC TERMINAL INTERFACE RECEIVES AN  ISIS  "B5"
              MESSAGE  -  LOGON FAILURE, IT WILL ZAP THE CORRESPONDING
              CIRCUIT.

          3.  THE SDLC TERMINAL INTERFACE HAS ALREADY RECEIVED A  REAL
              PSEUDO  NEEDLE  "B2"  FROM  THE  NODE  CODE, BUT IT THEN
              RECEIVES A SPURIOUS PSEUDO NEEDLE.   IN  THIS  CASE,  IT
              WILL ZAP THE CIRCUIT TO AVOID CONFUSION.
 
          4.  THE DSR SIGNAL DROPPED ON  THE  LINE  BETWEEN  THE  SDLC
              TERMINAL INTERFACE AND THE CONTROL UNIT.
 
          5.  A MONITOR USER ENTERED A SHUT  COMMAND  FOR  A  SPECIFIC
              STATION  VIA  THE MONITOR HOST CO-RESIDING WITH THE SDLC
              TERMINAL INTERFACE.
 
          6.  A MONITOR USER ENTERED A SHUT  COMMAND  FOR  A  TERMINAL
              LINE  VIA  THE  MONITOR  HOST  CO-RESIDING WITH THE SDLC
              TERMINAL INTERFACE.
 
 
 
      WHEN THE SDLC HOST INTERFACE RECOGNIZES THE CIRCUIT BEING ZAPPED, IT
      WILL:
 
 
          1.  RELEASE ALL THE INPUT BUFFERLETS, OUTPUT BUFFERLETS  AND
              THE  COMMAND  LINK  LISTS  WHICH  ARE  FLOWING  FROM THE
              BACKGROUND PROCESSING TO THE  FOREGROUND.   PLEASE  NOTE
              THAT  WHATEVER  DATA  SITTING  IN THE SIO BUFFERS REMAIN
              INTACT.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE SIO MOTHERBOARD WILL TRY TO
              TRANSMIT WHATEVER QUEUED UP IN ITS SIO TRASNMIT BUFFER.
 
          2.  SEND AN ISIS "9E"  DETACH  MESSAGE  TO  DISCONNECT  THIS
              USER.
 
 
 
      WHEN THE SDLC TERMINAL INTERFACE RECOGNIZES THE CIRCUIT BEING ZAPPED,
   IT WILL:
 
 
          1.  RELEASE ALL THE INPUT BUFFERLETS, OUTPUT BUFFERLETS  AND
              THE  COMMAD  LINK  LISTS  WHICH  ARE  FLOWING  FROM  THE
              BACKGROUND PROCESSING TO THE  FOREGROUND.   PLEASE  NOTE
              THAT  WHATEVER  DATA  SITTING  IN THE SIO BUFFERS REMAIN
              INTACT.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE SIO MOTHERBOARD WILL TRY TO
              TRANSMIT WHATEVER QUEUED UP IN ITS SIO TRANSMIT BUFFER.
 
          2.  INCREMENT THE LOGON RETRY COUNTER BY ONE.
 
          3.  IF WE HAVE NOT EXCEEDED THE LIMIT OF LOGON RETRY,  WHICH
              PRESENTLY IS HARDCODED TO 16 TIMES,
 
                      THEN THE TERMINAL INTERFACE WILL WAIT UNTIL  THE
                      PVCTIMER  TO  TIMEOUT;   WHICH IS DEFINED IN THE
                      TYMFILE.  AFTER THIS TIMER POPS,  IT  STARTS  TO
                      BUILD  THE  PVC  BY  SENDING  THE  PSEUDO NEEDLE
                      REQUEST AGAIN TO THE NODE CODE.
 
 
          4.  OTHERWISE;  THE TERMINAL INTERFACE REPORTS  THE  MESSAGE
              OF  EXCESSIVE  LOGON  RETRY TO THE SUPERVISOR'S LOG, AND
              SHUT OFF THIS STATION BY CLEARING THE CIRCUIT.

      IN THE SNA WORLD, WHEN A HALF-SESSION SENDS DATA TO ITS CORRESPONDING
   SESSION PARTNER, IT HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING IF THE SESSION PARTNER HAS
   RECEIVED THE DATA UNLESS IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY A RESPONSE.
 
      THERE ARE 3 TYPES OF RESPONSE PROTOCOLS IN THE SNA WORLD:
 
              1.  DEFINITE RESPONSE
                       THE SENDER REQUESTS THE RECEIVER  TO  RETURN  A
                  RESPONSE   UNCONDITIONALLY,   WHETHER   POSITIVE  OR
                  NEGATIVE, TO THAT REQUEST.
 
              2.  EXCEPTION RESPONSE
                       THE RECEIVER RETURNS A NEGATIVE  RESPONSE  ONLY
                  IF  THE RECEIVED DATA IS UNACCEPTABLE;  OTHERWISE IT
                  DOES NOT RESPOND AT ALL.
 
              3.  NO RESPONSE
                       NO MATTER THE RECEIVED DATA  IS  ACCEPTABLE  OR
                  UNACCEPTABLE,  THE  RECEIVER DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE
                  SENDER.
 
 
      THE USAGE OF THESE RESPONSES ARE ILLUSTRATED AS FOLLOWS:
 
              1.  RESPONSES  ARE  RETURNED  IF  THE  SESSION   PARTNER
                  REQUESTS FOR DEFINITE RESPONSES.

                                     NEGATIVE RESPONSE

              2.  RESPONSES  ARE  RETURNED  IF  THE  SESSION   PARTNER
                  REQUESTS FOR EXCEPTION RESPONSES.

               FOR  EVERY  SNA  MESSAGE,  IT  IS  PREFIXED  WITH   THE
          TRANSMISSION HEADER AND THE REQUEST/RESPONSE HEADER.  
               IN THE REQUEST HEADER, THERE ARE THREE BITS  INDICATING
          THE  TYPES  OF RESPONSES (I.E., DEFINITE RESPONSE, EXCEPTION
          RESPONSE, AND NO RESPONSE)  THAT  THE  SENDING  HALF-SESSION
          REQUESTS    FOR    THE    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT    OF   THIS   SNA
          REQUEST-MESSAGE.

               IN THE RESPONSE HEADER, THERE  IS  ONE  BIT  INDICATING
          WHETHER  THIS SNA RESPONSE-MESSAGE IS A POSITIVE RESPONSE OR
          A NEGATIVE ONE.
               IT  MAY  INCREASE  UNNECESSARY  LINE  TRAFFIC  IF   THE
          CUSTOMER  USES  THE  DEFINITE  RESPONSE  PROTOCOLS  FOR  ALL
          TRANSMISSIONS.  THE SNA DOES ALLOW, IN  FACT  IT  IMPLICITLY
          RECOMMENDS,  TO  USE A COMBINATION OF DEFINITE AND EXCEPTION
          RESPONSES TO ELIMINATE THE UNNECESSARY TRAFFIC DELAY.

               AS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO POINT IT OUT FROM THIS CHART THAT
          THE SNA PROTOCOL ENFORCES THE DEFINITE RESPONSE TO BE ISSUED
          FOR EVERY OUTSTANDING REQUEST MESSAGE IN THE SSCP-PU SESSION
          AND THE SSCP-LU SESSION.
               HOWEVER, THE PROTOCOL ALLOWS THE RESPONSE TO BE IN  ANY
          ONE  OF THE FORM OF DEFINITE RESPONSE, EXCEPTION RESPONSE OR
          NO RESPONSE FOR EVERY OUTSTANDING  REQUEST  MESSAGE  IN  THE
          LU-LU SESSION.
 
               ONCE  WE  HAVE  GONE  THROUGH   THE   SSCP-LU   SESSION
          ESTABLISHMENT AND PROCEED TO THE LU-LU SESSION, THE POSSIBLE
          DELAY CAUSED BY THE END-TO- END ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, WHICH IS  A
          MUST  IN  THE SSCP-PU OR SSCP-LU SESSIONS, CAN BE ELIMINATED
          BY  ADAPTING  A  MIXTURE  OF  THE  DEFINITE  RESPONSES   AND
          EXCEPTION RESPONSES.
 
               IF YOUR SDLC CUSTOMERS EVER HAVE COMPLAINTS  ABOUT  THE
          SLOW  RESPONSE  TIME  WHEN THEY USE THE SDLC INTERFACES, YOU
          MAY ADVISE THEM TO RESEARCH THEIR IBM VTAM GEN AND  THE  WAY
          THEIR  TRANSACTION-ORIENTED PROGRAMS ISSUE CALLS TO THE CICS
          OR IMS, OR TSO, OR OTHER MAJOR APPLICATION SYSTEMS.
 
               IN THE IBM VTAM  GEN,  THERE  IS  A  SET  OF  PARAMETER
          SETTINGS  TO  DEFINE THE BIND IMAGE.  THIS MACRO IS LOGMODE.
          UNDER THIS MACRO, IT LEAVES ROOM FOR THE VTAM PROGRAMMERS TO
          DEFINE  THE  FUNCTION  MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS FOR BOTH PRIMARY
          LOGICAL UNIT AND SECONDARY LOGICAL UNIT.   IN  THE  FUNCTION
          MANAGEMENT  PROTOCOL, IT ALSO PERMITS ANY COMBINATIONS OF NO
          RESPONSE, DEFINITE RESPONSE AND EXCEPTION RESPONSE.
 
               IN ADDITION TO OPTIMIZING THE LOGMODE PARAMETERS OF THE
          VTAM GEN, THE IBM MAJOR APPLICATION SYSTEMS ALSO PLAY A VERY
          IMPORTANT ROLE IN SPEEDING UP THE  COMMUNICATION  ROUND-TRIP
          TRAFFIC.   THESE  MAJOR  APPLICATION SYSTEMS SUCH AS CICS OR
          IMS, WHEN ISSUE THE SEND MACRO CALL TO  VTAM,  THEY  HAVE  A
          CHOICE  TO  TELL  VTAM  WHETHER THE APPLICATION SYSTEM SHALL
          EXPECT A DEFINITE  RESPONSE  OR  EXCEPTION  RESPONSE  OR  NO
          RESPONSE  TO  THE  SENDING  MESSAGE.  THEREFORE, THE NETWORK
          ROUND-TRIP DELAY CAN BE IMPROVED BY CICS ASKING AN EXCEPTION
          RESPONSE IN THE SEND MACRO.
 
               AFTER THE BIND IS SENT TO THE SECONDARY  LOGICAL  UNIT,
          BOTH HALF SESSION PARTNERS HAVE TO BE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE
          BINDING AGREEMENT.  THERE IS NO WAY  TO  ALTER  THE  BINDING
          AGREEMENT IN THE LU-LU SESSION.
 
               TYMNET  SDLC  INTERFACES  PROVIDE  AN  EXTENSION   CORD
          SERVICE  TO  THE  SDLC  USERS.   IT  DOES NEITHER SNA-TO-BSC
          PROTOCOL CONVERSION NOR SNA PROTOCOL VALIDATION.  IT  CHECKS
          WHATEVER  IS  DEFINED IN THE SDLC-LAYER'S PROTOCOL, WHICH IS
          VERY  MINIMAL  AS  OPPOSED  TO  OTHER   FIVE   UPPER-LAYERS'
          PROTOCOLS.   IT  SIMPLY PASSES WHATEVER IT RECEIVES FROM ONE
          END TO ANOTHER.  THEREFORE, IT DOES NOT WASTE TIME IN MAKING
          SURE  THAT  THE  USER  DATA CONFORMS TO THE PROTOCOLS OF SNA
          UPPER-LAYERS.

               PRESENT BACK-PRESSURE HANDLING IN THE SUPERVISOR
               ------------------------------------------------
               ------------------------------------------------


Written by : Ashok Chippa, HQ Network Staff Consultant
      Date : December 12, 1985




   PRESENT BACK-PRESURE HANDLING IN THE SUPERVISOR   
     
   1) There are two back-pressure control rings in the Sup to  
      pass bp (back-pressure) information to the node code (on 
      Sup base)   
           a) Input bp control ring   
           b) Output bp control ring  
     
   2) The Sup relieves bp before sending a T-I or T-II needle  
      for command circuit or before taking over a T-i or T-II  
      node through a T-II neighbour.  
     
   3) The Sup bp's a port if it receives early takeover response    
      errors from a node and during remove and retake processing.   
     
   4) The Sup processes bp information from the node code in the    
      input bp ring immediately before sending anything into the    
      output data ring. If the Sup receives any bp information for  
      a port which is out of range, the Sup will crash. Otherwise,  
      the Sup will set or relieve bp for that port.  
     
   5) The node code will not send anything on ports that have been  
      bp'ed by the Sup.
     
   6) The node code bp's the Sup if when moving the Sup data into   
      the network, a buffer's byte count exceeds an arbitrary  
      circuit speed of 3 (0400 bytes). Every pass through 'spider', 
      after all the Sup input and output processing, the node code  
      checks all the Sup channels previously bped and if their 
      byte counts do not exceed their circuit speeds as indicated   
      in the i/o table, then bp is relieved for the channel.   
      Following this check the output bp ring is checked for   
      indications of bp set or relief from the Sup.  
        
           From the above summary it is clear that presently the    
      Sup back-pressure is not related or connected in any way 
      to the number of free available bufferlets.    
     
   PRESENT HANDLING OF NUMBER OF FREE BUFFERLETS
     
   1) Total number of free bufferlets (NFREE) is maintained    
      constantly. This is because NFREE is updated whenever    
      a bufferlet or a list of bufferlets is withdrawn or 
      returned to the free pool. 
     
   2) NFREE is initialized to BLETSIZ (total) in the beginning.
     
   3) When transferring nodes from State 2 to 3 of takeover    
      NFREE is checked, and the transfer is carried only if    
      enough bufferlets are available.
     
   4) During the input dispatcher processing if NFREE is less  
      than 256d, the Sup tries tries to free up some bufferlets
      by calling OTROUT.    
     
   5) T-II logins are accepted only if NFREE is less than 200d.
     
   6) T-I logins are accepted only if NFREE is less than 200d. 
     
   7) When sending message strings to T-I node if NFREE is not 
      enough a 'bell' is sent instead.
     
   8) When sending message strings to T-II node if NFREE is not
      enough a 'bell' is sent instead.
     
   9) Auxiliary circuits are not started if NFREE is less than 250d.
        
   10) NFREE is updated in list handlers and therefore is 
       maintained constantly.    
     
   11) Rebuild requests are not accepted if NFREE is less than 200x.
     
           It is apparent that NFREE is checked for only certain    
      lists. For example NFREE is not checked while appending  
      zappers to the zapper list (zapper list is used only if T-I   
      nodes are present). Since TRW's problem is related to this, it
      is possible to modify this area to ignore zappers if NFREE    
      is less than some safe level. This would then require that    
      nodes resend the zappers at a later time. This may require    
      additional code changes to either node code or slot code 
      generating zaps. 
     
           The second approach of back-pressuring the messages from 
      a node when NFREE is low is more complicated and may require  
      additional protocols for the Sup and node communications and  
      substantial node code and Sup code changes.    
     
            Both these approaches have to be studied at a design    
      level and will require a PIR to NTD. 
     
           A new feature is added to the Sup to report the number   
      of free bufferlets to the error log every 30 minutes.    
     
           A quick and dirty solution is to increase the number of  
      of bufferlets to as much as the memory can permit.  
     
           The long term and the best solution is to eliminate 
      T-I nodes from the network.

     The following formula can be used to estimate the memory requirements
     for TMCS version 10.00 code generation.  It should give you a  number 
     very  close  to  (or always on the safe side) that  obtained  by code 
     generation.

   ************************************************************************

                  And now, an X.25 that can't be beat!

   X.25 V3.01 is now in Full Release in the Public Network. Version 3.01
   includes significant enhancements over the previous release versions. 
   We're certain that our customers will be more satisfied than ever with
   this new release!

   The following new external and internal features will appear in V3.01:

   o  Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC's) as specified in the CCITT X.25
      recommendation is now available.

   o  Throughput performance has improved.

   o  Reverse Charging can be forced to occur if a calling address contains
      a match with a specified character string.

   o  Improved debugging facilities allow selection of specific debugging
      functions such as packet buffer trace, packet trace and link trace, and
      repeat a selected sequence.

   o  The maximum number of simultaneous circuits is increased to 1024.

   o  Called and Calling Address Modification can be performed on addresses
      for networks when address requirements differ between networks. This
      is primarily for private networks and international gateways and gives
      the customer more flexibility for interconnections.

   o  A logical break key other than the "break key" can be specified as
      the break signal from the start-stop DTE for X.3 parameter 7. This
      gives the end user additional keyboard independence when accessing 
      the network.

   o  An assembly time ID can be specified containing the current date and
      time so that the NAD (Node Assembler/Debugger) symbols can be matched
      with the slot file.

   Preliminary formal documentation is available for some of the newly
   implemented features. These documents are available on System 39
   and are intended for Tymnet internal use only.  They are
   oriented towards the Communications Consultant and include
   detailed discussions of the features, as well as Tymfile generation
   statements. These documents are:

   (NETMID:39)PREFIX.DOC       International Prefix Feature Documentation

   (NETMID:39)RVCHG.DOC        Reverse Charge Forcing for Tymshare
                               X.25/X.75 Interface
   
   (NETMID:39)PVC.DOC          XCOM - PVC Feature for X.25 Interface
   
   (NETMID:39)CLDMAP.DOC       Called DTE address mapping

   Also, be sure to check your previous Baseline memos and Tech Alert
   files for technical information about features in the new release.

   In addition to the preliminary documents are the standard X.25/X.75
   publications manuals. These are:

   NPD-399                     X.25/X.75 Reference Manual V2.02

   We are currently updating the V2.02 Reference Manual and will let
   you know when the new version becomes available. In addition, we are
   working on a X.75 Gateway Connection Guide which should be available
   early in 1986. 

   As with any Full Release, no restrictions exist for ordering. All new
   X.25 orders placed through Order Processsing will be filled with
   V3.01. Additionally, we recommend that you begin to migrate your
   present X.25 customers to the new release version, so that they may
   benefit from the improvements.

   Well, there it is. Now it's your turn to hit the streets and
   tell the world: "we've got an X.25 for you!"

      A patch is now available to provide realtime display of X.PC packet 
   information through Extended DDT. This can make the process of trouble-
   shooting X.PC problems somewhat easier and quicker. The patch can be 
   installed in any version 1.04 or 1.05 X.PC Network Server - and is already
   installed in those Servers in the public network answering to host number 
   7132 (username XPC, among others).

   To Use:

    - Enter Extended DDT for the given Server. "?STAT" at the DDT prompt.
    - Enter "DPTF" at the Extended DDT prompt, ":>".
    - Any further keyboard input will terminate the display, and return you
      the ":>" prompt.

   The Output:

    - Fields are self explanatory (assuming you've read the X.PC Field Guide*).
      with the following exception.
    - The field labeled "IN/OUT" is coded:
      00 = Input to the Server
      01 = Output from the Server
      02 = Input having a bad packet-trailer CRC
      9E+ = ISIS Control Msg.

   The patchfile is: (techserv:25/33/54/70)ptfddt.pat, and should be assembled
   after any other patchfiles.

          MORE THINGS YOU WANT(?) TO KNOW ABOUT X.25 AND XCOM 

     FOR WATCHFUL XCOM CODE 'GEN'ers:

     If you use the CLGADR Sysgen Statement with the 'adr' 
     option, you may have noticed that the message doesn't get printed
     correctly during assembly of the XCOM03.R01 module.  Instead of 
     printing the address you used for the 'adr', you see what
     appears to be garbage.

     The problem is only with the gen message.  The macro statement
     used to print the parameter data is coded incorrectly.  

     What was requested:  CLGADR(-NUIADR,310601234500)
     What was printed:  CLGADR(-NUIADR,CLGM|QL|)

          CLGM|QL| is an expression that should have been
     evaluated as 310601234500 and not printed verbatim.

     The data in the NIB file is correct.
     This error in the gen print out should not cause any problems 
     with the operation of the code.

     This cannot be fixed by a patch since it is genned before the patch
     file is activated.  It will be fixed in future releases of XCOM.

     Thanks to John Bell for spotting this.


       **** EXTRA DATA IN CALL USER DATA FIELD CAUSING ERROR

     Data in the Call Request Packet will be handled as follows:

     If there is no data in the CALL USER DATA, and TKSUP option is set,
       and if the called address does not include a destination host --
       the customer will see a PLEASE LOG IN message.  If there is data
       in the CUD and no called address with destination host, the 
       CUD data will be used to form the USERNAME.

     When the CUD field contained (47 32), which was not a valid
     username, an error message and "Please Log In" was returned.

     There are three ways to avoid this:
       1.  After the DNIC, include a valid NTN
           (Network Terminal Number) in the called address.
           In this case, the format "9 + <1 to 9 digits>" indicates a
           2- to 10-digit Network User Number that is used as a
           username.  (See X.25/X.75 Reference Manual, page 7)

       2.  Make data in the CUD a valid username.

       3.  Have NO data in the CUD if you want the PLEASE LOG IN message.



        **** WHEN YOU CAN'T USE THE BRIEF CALL ACCEPT PACKET

     When either Window Size Negotiation or Packet Size Negotiation
     is defined, the Call Accept Packet must be able to
     respond to the window or packet size requested.  The Brief Call
     Accept Packet consists of three octets only -- General Format 
     Identifier, Logical Channel Number and Packet Type Identifier--
     so there is no way to include the Packet Size or Window Size
     facility.  See X.25/X.75 Reference Manual, page 59 (Packet Size
     Statement, +Negotiation option) which says,          
         "Always includes PS facility in the call accept packet."

     The Brief Call Accept Packet cannot be used if either Window
     or Packet Size Negotiation is desired.  The full Call Accept
     Packet is required to carry the negotiation information.


        **** HELPING OUT UNFRIENDLY CUSTOMER SOFTWARE

     When a customer's X.25 PAD did not insert a calling address
     into the Call Request Packet sent to the interface, the call 
     was cleared for improper calling address.  Since it was 
     difficult for the customer to change, TYMNET came to the rescue
     with a solution--use the CHECK CALLING ADDRESS statement
     CHKCLG(adr) where 'adr' represents the beginning digits of
     the calling address in a call request from the Link.

     The main purpose of this statement appears to be to check
     the validity of the calling address in call request packets
     from the link to the interface.  Indeed, if the digits in
     'adr' do not match the digits of the calling address, the
     call will be cleared.  But IF THERE ARE NO DIGITS IN THE
     CALLING ADDRESS FIELD OF THE CALL REQUEST PACKET, 'adr'
     WILL BE SUBSTITUTED.  See X.25/X.75 Reference Manual, page 55.

        **** BIG PROBLEMS WITH BIG GENS FOR XCOM VERSION 2.02

     When you get a fatal assembly error with data out
     of range when you are genning a XCOM Version 2.02 system,
     check how many DPORTS you have specified.  Version 2.02
     is limited in size.  There is no way to patch.  You may as
     well move to 3.01 and beat the crowd.  2.02 is due to expire
     next April anyway.
     BIGGER AND BETTER WITH 3.01, NOW IN FULL RELEASE.

      THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES HOW THE SUPERVISOR INTERPRETS AND ACTS UPON
   CHARACTERS FOUND WITHIN A PASSWORD STRING.  APPARENTLY THERE IS NO 
   LIMITATION UPON THE PASSWORD STRING AS PRESENTED TO THE MUD FROM NETVAL
   SO THIS IS THE ONLY GOVERNING FORCE OVER PASSWORD SET UP.

   ALL VALUES GIVEN IS HEXADECIMAL.

   RULE 1.  IF CHARACTER FOUND IS '03' CIRCUIT IS ZAPPED.

   RULE 2.  AFTER CHECKING FOR '03', ALL CHARACTERS ARE LOGICALLY AND
   	         WITH '7F'.  THUS CHARACTERS '80' - 'FF' ARE INTERPRETED
   	          AS '00 - '7F' IN THE FOLLOWING RULES.

   RULE 3.  '00' HAS NO INTERPRETATION AND IS IGNORED.

   RULE 4.  '01' - '0C' ARE ALLOWED.  ('03' EXCEPTED BECAUSE OF RULE 1 ABOVE,
                 '83' ALLOWED).

   RULE 5.  '0D' WILL TERMINATE THE PASSWORD STRING.

   RULE 6.  '0E' - '1A' ARE ALLOWED.

   RULE 7.  '1B' - '1F' ARE INTERPRETED AS ESCAPE (ABORT LOGIN).

   RULE 8.  '20' - '3A' ARE ALLOWED.

   RULE 9.  '3B' - WILL TERMINATE PASSWORD STRING.  I CAN FIND NO FUNCTIONAL
                 DIFFERENCE WITH '0D' AT THIS TIME.

   RULE 10. '3C' - '5F' ARE ALLOWED.

   RULE 11. '60' - '7A' ARE ALLOWED BUT ARE INTERPRETED AS '40' - 5A'.

   RULE 12. '7B' - '7D' ARE INTERPRETED AS '1B' CAUSING ESCAPE.

   RULE 13. '7E' IS INTERPRETED AS '1D' CAUSING ESCAPE.

   RULE 14. '7F' IS INTERPRETED AS '00' AND IS IGNORED.

                        ANALYZING SUPERVISOR CRASHES

      The following is a procedure written by Greg Matoka of NTD, you will be
   able to read out from the disk the contents of the registers at the time of
   the supervisor slot crash.  Please send me a copy of the contents of the 
   registers and the location of the supervisor files.  Please ontymn me if 
   you have further questions.


   When analyzing sup crashes, the following steps should be taken:

   1) Freeze the sup. 

   2) Build a circuit through NAD to the sup, and set up the proper NIB file.

   3) Save the current data area to disk with ":sdsav3,savdsz/4,0".  Then load
      the crashed data area from disk into memory with ":ldsav1,savdsz/4,0".

   4) Read out the contents of the registers with ":m1,crsave,crsave+48",
      ":x1,4,2"

   5) Find out the crash location in relation to a label, e.g., if the crash
      occurred at 0DFE3E, (which will be displayed in the Probe log, told to 
      you by NETCON, or else contained in the word following R15 of the crash
      registers), then do a "0DFE3E_  LSCANI+18".

   6) As far as hints to help analyze the crash, here are my suggestions:
        a) Go to the source code and find out what the sup was doing at
        the time. I.e. was it processing a list structure, handling a
        login, an operator request, building a circuit, etc.

        b) Find out how the sup got to the routine where the crash
        occurred. Usually this is contained in the LINK register (R11)
        and it is usually a very valuable bit of information. Also,
        sometimes a previous LINK reg was stored in a memory location,
   	e.g., CLINK, which can give a trail to the crash routine.

   7) Very Important. When you're finished, be sure to restore the data
      area. This is done with a ":ldsav3,savdsz/4,0". Thaw the sup and inform
      NETCON whether they can run on it or not.

   8) It is difficult to analyze a crash unless you've seen the same crash
      twice. In that way, a definite pattern can be established and will
      eliminate a lot of possibilities.

      EVERY X.25 INTERFACE should have an OUCH patch or, if using

      XCOM Version 3.01, the BETATEST patch file (BETATEST)XCOM03.P01.


     YOU SHOULD EITHER:
     Use the new BETATEST patch file (BETATEST)XCOM03.P01 which
     includes the OUCH patch.........
          HOWEVER
         Use of the BETATEST patch file must be cleared with NTD.
         Check with ERIC BUELL, by ONTYME:  NTD.E/BUELL
                                Or phone:  (408) 446-7874

     OR --
     Add the OUCH patch to your command file
     and continue to use the SOURCE patch file.

     OUCH.301 is on systems 25, 33, 54 and 70 in HQXCOM directory.

     OUCHWK.301 is in the same directory on the same systems.
     This one should be used if you want to use the +HILCN option
     of the PKTOPT sysgen statement.

     Please contact Network Support Services, X.25 Support if you have
     any problems with either of these patches.

        ATTENTION:  Everyone working with CONSAT PAD !!


      Please use the Product ID 'XPAD' when submitting NSR's,

      Escalations or RFI's relating to the PAD functions of

      the CONSAT.  The CONSAT PAD, ISCS04.R00 or ISCS04.R01,

      is now in BETATEST.    Using the ID of XPAD for PAD
  
      functions, rather than ISCS, will make it easier for

      NTD and HQ Network Support to give you prompt service.


      Thank you for your help.
