     The following is a sysnopsis of DNE's tasks to facilitate engineerings
physical cutover at all edge sites:

     a.  Physical port allocation along with ISIS framework generation.  This
has been completed at this time and my database has been updated and ready
for promulgation.

     b.  Slot code generation along with corresponding PVC application forms.

     c.  Schedule all testing with local customers, if testing is unable to
be accomplished during engineerings prescribed timeframe, we have devised
contingency plans in the unlikely event this occurs.

     d.  The following is a personnel schedule for deployment to the respec-
tive sites:

          1.  Kim Holland - to Los Angeles and San Francisco.

          2.  Clinton A. Rowe - Miami, Toronto, Houston.

     Since the ultimate responsibility of signing the edge offices off
resides with DNE, I feel that it is imperative that our presence is needed
at each and every site, not to act as a spectator, but to lend totally
undivided and full participation in all tasks that are to be undertaken 
by engineering personnel.
