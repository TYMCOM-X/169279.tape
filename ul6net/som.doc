              3.4.1  Logging into the System Monitor
 
 
 
  A  unique host  number is  used  in each  SDLC interface  for  the system
  monitor.  Users with the appropriate network validation can log into this
  host number and  access the system  monitor. Do not  use NAD to  log into
  system monitor. When using Nad  a double echo appears at  users terminal.
  Either log  in directly, or  use MUX or  AUXIO.  The system  monitor will
  initially prompt the user with:
 
 
  SDLC Interface Monitor
 
           Enter Terminal Type, 0TY, 1P, 2DM.
 
           >_
 
 
 
  Three types of terminals are  supported by the system monitor,  low speed
  hard-copy  terminals, Tymshare  Model 444  (HP), and  Tymshare  Model 425
  (ADM-1A).  The 0TY mode is LINE mode which will display the slot status
  by scrolling.  Even with  a Tymshare  Model 444  (HP) terminal,  the user
  still can select 0 if the users prefers to have line mode.   However, the
  selection  of  1  or 2  must  be  for that  paticular  type  of terminal,
  otherwise the displayed  information will not  be readable.  To  select a
  terminal type, the user enters  the terminal type followed by  a carriage
  return.  The  system monitor  then outputs  the Interface  Status Display
  until a command is issued or the operator logs off.  The Interface Status
  Display consists of:
 
 
     o  header line, with SDLC interface ID, Node number, and Slot number

     o  detail line,  with interface version  number, time either  the slot
         was first initialized or the  time of the last crash  (Halting the
         slot will  not update the  crash time), the  crash count,  and the
         last crash code

              3.5.1  Logging into Extended DDT
 
 
       SYNTAX: ::?STATUS (cr)
 
 
       The SDLC Extended DDT is  similar to Extended DDT packages  in other
  interfaces.  The user must first log into DDT before issuing the Extended
  DDT  command  '::?STATUS'.  Once  this  command  has  been  entered,  the
  acknowledgement  header will  be displayed  along with  the  Extended DDT
  prompt ':>'.
 
 
       For a display of all possible commands available at this  point, the
  user need only type in '::?' or '::HELP'. Before entering any of the menu
  commands, '::' must be typed in first.
 
 
 
 
 
              3.5.2  Extended DDT Display Ring Commands
 
 
       The commands  used to  display ISIS  Input and  Output Rings  are as
  follows:
 
      ::DIR <ARG>      Display Dispatcher Input Ring from the
                       starting address <ARG>, or if no <ARG>
                       is defined display starts from the begin-
                       ning of the ring.
 
      ::DOR <ARG>      Display Dispatcher Output Ring from the
                       starting address <ARG>, or if no <ARG>
                       is defined display starts from the begin-
                       ning of the ring.
 
      ::DR             Display Dispatcher Input and Output rings
                       continuously, until user types in `\`.

              3.5.3  Extended DDT Symbol Address Display
 
 
       Some  symbol addresses,  commonly needed  for testing  purposes, are
  available using the following command:
 
      ::SYM            Prints a list of symbol addresses, such as IRING
                       and ORING.
 
 
 
 
 
              3.5.4  Extended DDT Real Time SDLC Line Display
 
 
       The  SCOPE  command  is  used to  display  real  time  SDLC protocol
  information,  being both  transmitted and  received on  any  user defined
  line. The format for this command is as follows:
 
      ::SCOPE <ARG>    Display transmit and receive SDLC protocol
                       information for the line specified by
                       <ARG>. To stop the continuous display type
                       in `\`.
 
      Example Display:
 
      ::SCOPE 1       
 
      **********PRIMARY LINE**********
      MNE          ADDRESS    CONTROL     FASTC
      X SNRM         40         93        6CE141C9
      R UA           40         73        6CE14241
      X RR           40         11        6CE1425F
      R INF          40         10        6CE1427D
      * R SNRM       40         93        6CE1445D
 
 
       If the line defined  by <ARG> in the  SCOPE command is defined  as a
  primary line in the TYMFILE the header will appear as in the example. For
  a  secondary  line the  header  will display  SECONDARY  LINE  instead of
  PRIMARY LINE.
 
 
       The first field of the display is for the SDLC mneumonic. The prefix
  of X indicates transmit frame, prefix R indicates receive frame, and an *
  prefix indicates  this frame does  not follow the  SDLC protocol.  In the
  example,  the last  frame is  `* R  SNRM`. This  is an  error,  because a
  secondary  station is  never suppose  to transmit  command frames  to the
  primary station. The second field  of the display is SDLC  address field.
  The third field  of the display is  SDLC control field. The  fourth field
  specified the fast clock of ISIS.

              3.5.5  Extended DDT Menu Display
 
 
       There are  two commands  available to display  the menu  of possible
  Extended DDT commands:
 
      ::?         Display menu of commands
 
      ::HELP      Display menu of commands
 
 
 
 
 
              3.5.6  Terminate Extended DDT Mode
 
 
       The user  can either terminate  Extended DDT by  logging off,  or by
  returning to operator monitor.
 
      ::Q        Return to DDT
 
      ::ZZ       Log Off
 
      ::EXI      Log Off
