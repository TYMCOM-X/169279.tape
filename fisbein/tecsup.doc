  This document specifies the goals and tasks of the European Customer
Support Group which main objective remains the resolution of the
technical
problems reported by BT's customers located in Europe.




  This main objective can be summed up with the three following steps :

  1. Put the customer back in business as soon as possible;
  2. Understand the customer's concerns regarding the reported incident;
  3. Fix the problem to the customer's satisfaction and within the best
     possible time frames.




I. Problem documentation analysis.

   This refers to the PAPER ticket documentation which needs be accurate
   and up to date. Refer to Marjorie Jacobs's GNS transborder fault
handling
   procedure document as guidelines to complete this step.


II. Research of complementary information.

   The ticket itself may only refer to the immediate customer context
and
   require some more in-depth documentation to be analysed before
attempting
   any resolution approach.
