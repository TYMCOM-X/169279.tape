:	Patch by :		Stephane Fisbein - European Operations
:	Patch to module :	ISCS06.R03
:	Version :		6.03
:	Related NSR # :		
:	Description :		When using the NOIIX option to disable
:				the IIX capability in the RNP message,
:	the node code replies eventually with a NCC (B6) message with
:	the IIX bit off. However, in an SDN environment, the node code
:	is replaced by the LCP which handles the IIX logic differently
:	and forgets to reset the IIX bit in the B6. Thus leading to the
:	consat to wait for the IIX handshaking in vain. Though the bug
:	is in the LCP, it is easier for the time being, and also
:	harmless for all possible usages of the consat to patch the
:	consat in order to simply ignore the IIX flag of the B6 message
:	when the NOIIX flag is set. This patch is to be assembled AFTER
:	the (asyncpat)noiix.603 patch
