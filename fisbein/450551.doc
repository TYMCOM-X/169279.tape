Alessandro, Angelo, the trace provided has many strange aspects. A general
remark is that it seems that both ends take a long time to react to the other
end's commands. Also, there seems to be several problems showing up in this
trace. I am refering this ticket to STS for any suggestive input, but in the

 --# 10 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 23-OCT-92 @16:38 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
meantime, I would like you to reply to the following points :
1. Can you trace a FT in the XDDT when the problem shows up.
2. Can you get hold of an hexadecimal trace of the problem ?
3. Can you take the SIO status before and after the problem ?

 --# 11 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 23-OCT-92 @16:38 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
4. When did the customer start to complain about this problem ? Is it related
   to any particular change in the customer environment lately ?
In the trace provided, it looks like the info frame # 7 never reached the host
computer. When the host received the next frame (# 0) it replied with REJ 7.

 --# 12 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 23-OCT-92 @16:38 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
For some reason, the XCOM resent frame # 7 a bit too late but I'm not 100% sure
that the FRMR is a response to the info 4 1 . The FRMR analysis tends to show
that the info frame rejected would be the info 4 3. If you could provide a hex
trace, we could have a deeper analysis of the real cause of this problem.

     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
I don't have much to add besides what Fisbein said.  It appears the root
cause is a host buffering problem, because rnr's coming from the host
always precede the problem.  Note that we send the frame with a good
checksum but the host still does not receive it, or acts like they

 --# 21 STATUS ENTERED FROM TECHSERV        BY STS ON 28-OCT-92 @ 1:01 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
don't receive it.  After host sends us REJ frame, we do retransmit the
rejected frame, but there is a delay because other frames are already
in the queue.  It looks like it is a very busy time, the host can't handle
so much traffic, and that's what starts the problem.   ..Jerry Lucas

I am still working on trying to reproduce your problem. I went as far as
getting the bad RNR recovery. As far as the REJ and subsequent FRMR are con-
cerned, I think they are related to a buffer problem in the host.
However,I am also checking the reason why the host had to FRMR in this case

 --# 34 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON  5-NOV-92 @17:09 ZULU.

(invalid N(R)).
I tried to call you today and yesterday without success. I'll try again
tomorrow. In the meantime, can you answer the following :
1. Is there any other location where the same problem might have been observed?

 --# 35 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON  5-NOV-92 @17:09 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
2. You mentionned that the customer has this problem since he changed his host
model. What is so different between those two models that can explain such a
different behaviour ?
3. The reason why you didn't catch the REJ in your FT trace was probably

 --# 38 STATUS ENTERED FROM SIRTITAS        BY RL  ON  6-NOV-92 @10:05 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
The problem is observed only when working with our customer's new
host model (LSX4000 Olivetti). Its frequency is higher if this machine
is a central host, rather than a peripherical host, but we have it
in both cases.

 --# 39 STATUS ENTERED FROM SIRTITAS        BY RL  ON  6-NOV-92 @10:05 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
2. In comparison with the old model (CPS32 Olivetti), the new host has
   a quicker speed in internal data-processing, but a slower line-handling
   ability (in the hold model a co-processor unit was dedicated to I/O
   data handling).

 --# 40 STATUS ENTERED FROM SIRTITAS        BY RL  ON  6-NOV-92 @10:05 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
   We tried to bring lines speed down, from 19.2 Kbps to 9.6 Kbps, but
   the problem still occurs with the same frequency.
3. You can find a REJ, and subsequent FRMR's, detected by FT in XCOM,
   in the file X25FT, near the end of the file.  RL.

Thanks for the info ! Regarding point 3, I meant FRMR, sorry.
It is obvious that the way the host handles its I/O influences the frame level
behaviour. We are trying to set up a trap patch to understand why the slot
does not recover from the DCE busy state more properly. The rest of the

processing capability. In parallel, I would like to know if the LSX4000
from Olivetti is an approved equipment on GNS, and if there are any particular

Sorry to have forgotten to status this, but we've been working on this new
trace and dump today. I have isolated the interesting part of the trace in
(fisbein:33)x25tra . This and the dump show the following :
1. the final FRMR received has an info field C1 96 08

 --# 63 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 25-NOV-92 @17:02 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
2. the rejected frame is the RR 6
3. the DTE's internal variables are V(S)=3 & V(R)=4 which means that the last
   info frame sent by the host was an INFO R4,S2. But the strange thing, unless
   I got confused, is that the FRMR seems to indicate that the rejected frame

 --# 64 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 25-NOV-92 @17:02 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
was a command one.
4. bit Z is set to indicate an invalid N(R) .
With the exception of the command/response bit, the only explanation I have
for the FRMR is a host buffering problem with I/O (very long reactions).

 --# 65 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 25-NOV-92 @17:02 ZULU.

However, the whole thing comes from the slot keeping on sending I frames after
having received RNR.

SORRY I DID NOT HAVE MUCH TIME TO LOOK AT THIS TICKET TODAY.  I AGREE
WITH YOUR FINDINGS THOUGH.  THE FRMR IS FOR THE C1 FRAME, WHICH IS
SO LONG AGO IT IS NO LONGER EVEN IN OUR ROTOR LIST FOR THAT LINK.  I DON'T
THINK THAT THE SLOT IS SENDING DATA THROUGH THE RNR, I THINK THAT THE SLOT

HAS AN OPEN WINDOW AND PUTS AS MANY FRAMES OUT AS IT CAN. (LESS THAN
FRAME WINDOW).  AS THE HOST IS RECEIVING THEM IT SENDS RNR FOR EACH ONE.
IT OCCURS AFTER THE REJ BECAUSE THE REJ FORCE THE SLOT TO RETRANSMIT MANY
FRAMES.  BUT EVEN IF THE HOST WAS BACKED UP WHY WOULD IT FRMR THE C1?  EVEN

Roberto, the best guess we can make for the moment is that, by reducing the
frame window size, we leave less possibilities for the host to be out of
buffers. Can you envisage a reduction of K on both ends ? On the XCOM side,

problem. The host behaves strangely. I am sorry, but it is difficult to insure
a radical solution with the frame window size reduction. This is just a

Yes, please record FT and, if possible datascope, when testing a new value for
K. Try to arrange several tests with different values of K. This can be p
presented to the customer as an optimization process. I don't know how easy
(or uneasy) it is for the customer to change K on their side, but you know

easy for the customer, and if he agrees to cooperate smoothly, you could try
K=5,3,2 for example. Otherwise, just try to suggest to test K=3 for example.
We'll decide on the next action on the outcome of the test. Please let me

With these, I'll be able to make some more tracing and monitoring without
disturbing you. In the meantime, I have come to the following temporary
conclusion :
1. When XCOM receives the first RNR (with N(R)=7), it already has the next

 --#124 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 11-JAN-93 @10:32 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
   I frame being sent(with N(S)=7). The latter is acked with RNR 0.
2. Since the RNR received by XCOM acknowledges all previous sent frames,
   XCOM may send the next I frame, per CCITT 1988 paragraph 2.4.5.7, and so

 --#125 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 11-JAN-93 @10:32 ZULU.

3. For the same reason, XCOM sends the next I frame, which contains a packet
   with the M bit. This frame (with N(S)=1) is not acked. Some more tracing
   is necessary here to determine if there is any relation between the M bit
   (layer 3) and the host busy condition (layer 2).

   resumes sending I frames since its window allows it.

   what the host sends, in particular it acks the host I frame # 5 with an
   RR 6, before receiving the REJ 1.
7. XCOM resumes sending I frames from # 1 at this moment.

Thank you. Don't forget to log in with CTRL-X CTRL-R when you will transfer it
on the PDP. In the meantime, I am tracing the slot. I have very few occurrences
of the problem, maybe 1 per day. However, I cannot confirm the relation with

I have compiled both traces in (fisbein:26)x25.12 . We have three phenomenons :
1. The host sends RNRs on many occasions, thus proving a buffering problem in
the host. However, the RNR N(R) is increased and Tymnet copes with it OK.
2. The host REJ us before we even get a chance to retransmit the first

 --#152 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 22-JAN-93 @17:35 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
unacknowledged frame. Since we were sending frames in sequence and within the
open window, this is probably an unexpected reaction from the host. Perhaps, T1
should be lowered on the Tymnet side to allow quicker recovery from non acked
frames.

 --#153 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 22-JAN-93 @17:35 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
3. When Tymnet reacts on the incoming REJ, resends the right frame with the
right N(S). However, it seems that the N(R) is wrong. I suppose that N(R)
should be equal to V(R) instead of the N(R) value of the rejected frame.

The point in lowering T1 is to have XCOM attempt to recover from the unacked
frame faster, namely before the host goes into REJ, and subsequent FRMR. I
have already made some testing, but the results were not conclusive. I had
less FRMR, but many more REJs and RNRs. So, there is something to dig in the

STephane, I reviewed this ticket and have one thought that has not been
mentioned so far in the statuses.  Hardware switch should not be set for
fast interrupt.  If you log in to xray, do a cl command to get the time,
then wait one minute, do it again, time should increment by one minute

not four minutes.  Bad setting of the interrupt switch can lead to a lot
of crazy problems like maybe this one.  Other thought is if you are
getting foreground or background overload messages in TMCS you can adjust
the equates q.fgx and q.bgx where x is slot number to try to get rid of

bet.  Particularly bad problems come about when the foreground gets
interrupted.  Will research the dumps.   ...Jerry Lucas

Roberto, here is the outcome of the conference call held today between STS
Ken Stone & Doug Ellenberg and myself, and the actions proposed :

   maintenance or something.
2. We would like to know how the customer's host system reports this problem:
   tracing tool, monitor console, error logger, ...
3. Although this may sound boring to the customer, arrange to trap a couple

 --#197 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 11-FEB-93 @23:34 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
   of other dumps with FRMRTP.403 with the corresponding datascope traces
   because we need to match the two elements.
4. Seperately from point 3. above, arrange to trap a couple of dumps with
   patch REJINF.403 instead of FRMRTP.403 . REJINF will give us the internal

are trying to help him identify a possible problem with his host.

In the meantime, here are the answers regarding the first two points:

   Standing this fact, we think you agree in considering a "not realistic"
   possibility some hardware malfunction.
   An other possibility, still regarding hardware, could be the fact that
   switches are erroneously set for "fast interrupt" (see entries # 177 & 178).

    Regarding this last hypothesis, we repeat that the position of our
    switches is the same one we had when working with the old host model,
    which did not suffer for this problem.
    Anyway, this consideration is not enough to discard the bad set for

    switches

    (on the SIO daughter or controller , or on some other board) we have
    to act on, in order we can disable the fast interrupt.

even if it is not obvious at all that Tymnet is faulty in this problem, the

Mr. Stone, the answer to your critical question is: YES! the problem still
occurs with k=7 on both sides (that is the normally used value for k).

that K was 7 when the problem was originally reported. He told me that there

Ken, I had a quick look at (johnsonp:33)frmr.403 . This patch was made during

Therefore, I don't see any particular in removing it. Nor do I see any

   realized that the problem persisted.
2. As for Zucchetti's trace, there is a misunderstanding: it is one of the
   old traces, taken in the past with version 4.02.
3. We are 90 % sure (going to get a confirm) that we have this problem only

Based on my traces mentionned above, it seems that version 7.02 is showing
the two problems separately. Frmr.trc shows the REJ recovery problem which
seems to be independent from the RNRs (rej.trc) . The FRMR aspect of the

 --#294 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 13-APR-93 @11:00 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
the problem remains with 7.02 and is absolutely similar to the one of 4.03 .
1. Since the customer has come back to 4.03, and the FRMR problem remains in
   the same conditions, except that we know it can happen independently of the
   RNRs, is this enough information to re-focus on this problem with 4.03 ?

   an XCOM slot ? Note that I am sure we have a lot of counter examples.

Ken, can you please consider the above statement by Roberto Leone and talk to
the ISIS gurus, because, if experimentation confirms it, it would be deeper
than just SIO since they have the problem in a node with XCOM and UTS only
when UTS is running (daytime). However, the problem shows up slightly more

 --#310 STATUS ENTERED FROM FISBEIN         BY CSG ON 16-APR-93 @ 7:30 ZULU.

frequently when XCOM shares the node with SDLC.
With UTS, it shows up during daytime, probably because UTS is not used at
night (mainly office work).

Here are the results of our tests:
1. A slot x.25 running alone in a node, still suffers for the problem.
2. the frequence of the problem is higher when an sdlc slot runs with
   the x.25 slot, in the same node.

Actions for Sirti :
1. Can you please describe as precisely as possible all the devices, cables,
   connector types, patch pannels that are linking the LSX4000 to the engine ?
2. Did someone connect the LSX4000 to the engine via a modem eliminator, thus

problem.  Thanks to Tod Penniman of the Boston office who had the problem
with Fidelity Bank and also recognized that Autostrade was really using
Stratus equipment (their Olivetti is just Stratus OEM).  According to Tod,
the Stratus equipment has an upper limit on how many transmissions it can

 --#406 STATUS ENTERED FROM TECHSERV        BY STS ON 22-JUN-93 @21:50 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
receive per second.  The size of the transmissions is not important, as long
as the number of them per second does not go over the limit.  When this
happens, Stratus gets very confused, sends RNR's, REJ's, etc. exactly like
Autostrade is seeing.  Tod Penniman got around this problem by increasing

 --#407 STATUS ENTERED FROM TECHSERV        BY STS ON 22-JUN-93 @21:52 ZULU.
     REPORT SENT YET ?: NO
the packet size from 128 to 256.  Thus, the number of transmissions was
reduced significantly enough so that the problem never happened again.
This sounds like it's definitely worth trying.  256 or 512 will probably
fix it, since a precedent exists with another customer.

of the patch to look like : AIS R2,4 to push bfrinx 4 bytes further after
ST R3,TRCBFR,R2, . Also, the test at TRACIT+6 should be CLHI R2,7F70 to

So, it seems that PSIZE(256) reduces considerably the problem frequency. Now,
we need to focus on the other actions, independently of the above result. It is
important that the customer set PSIZE to 128 for the other tests. When all
these tests will be over, it will be time to eventually conclude that PSIZE

improvement, you may want to go further and try 512 or even 1024.
The idea is that the Stratus box is limited to a certain number

Stephane: first findings from dump: there is a bug with how we handle
rnr frames.  If the flag OTHBSY is set but the flag XSBUSY is not set,
it is possible that we will keep sending frames even when the host sends
us rnr.  I have verified that we are doing this in the dump, and have

bug in /ntdlib/xcompat/rnrinf.403 and rnrinf.702, which I also copied to
(xcompat:33).  If possible, I would encourage you to try the patch with

meet with Dennis later in the week to get his ideas.  I think maybe the

us to receive rnr frames from the host, and the bug may not have showed

I have genned a version 4.03 slot on 25 and loaded it in lab. Had calls e
established and traffic going through. No anomaly detected. I suggest that
Sirti assembles this patch in a particular slot on syst 33 for testing
purposes. This MUST be separated from any other ongoing test. We must clearly

conflict between the rnrinf patch and a patch by Ernst in the same area

another patch called rnrin2.403 under xcompat 25 that will be compatible

rnrin2.403.  rnrin2.403 should be in the command file AFTER xcom04.p03.

(2) 702 has a little better chance of fixing this than 403; (3) He was
surprised that the patch rnrin2.403 did not help at all.   Based on this,
he recommended an improvement to sirti.trp and sirti.trc to trap the
first 4 bytes (actually 2 bytes of length and 2 bytes of beginning of frame)

version 7.02 with the patch rnrinf.702.  Final recommendation, if you cnado it,
patch sirti.trp tocrash the slot and CRSTOP set.  (2) Get dump again as
before.

(3) Incorporate the trap patch sirti.trp anticipating the problem to
continue to happen.  (4) (If not too much trouble) Set up a datascope
as before to capture the problem, maybe triggering on the FRMR, because

Just a question, whether you can still see instances of rnr - rej

True. Furthermore, the RNR-REJ frequency will decrease when Olivetti will fix
the Stratus problem. Stephane. ECSG.

We consider closed the problem and this ticket.  Thanks,
