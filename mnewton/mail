   Martin,

       The Netval restore finished about 15 mins ago. I am currently doing
the last step before loading Netval which is the regen parameter. This scans
the entire CUD to determine the next UUN and GAN. It seems to be taking 
longer than I thought. I can't tell if its working or not. Do you know any
way of telling????

  MARTIN,

       Netval has loaded, class and group tables look good, CUD looks ok!
I have enabled both sup's and will run a consistency nochange to see
if there are any differences between CUD sup 1 and MUD sup 2 but all looks ok!!

       I don't think there is any more needs doing....do you????

     Wayne
