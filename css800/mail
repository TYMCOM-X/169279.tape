I can't update ticx
Sorry - 

I can't updatetickets now.  I assume some program or something is
running using the databases.

Can you (whoever gets this) look at ticket 503659 to make sure it
has the RESLV set so no one gets called on it this weekend.  The
copy I saw didn't have this set even though the CS just wants to
have the dump looked at (the slot is up and happy).

Thanks,
Doug.
