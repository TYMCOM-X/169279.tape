SELECT SKINS OR STROKE PLAY

1.  USE THE MOUSE TO POINT THE POINTER AT THE BOX BESIDE THE NUMBER OF
PLAYERS YOU WANT TO PLAY.  NOTICE THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE IN EITHER THE SKINS OR
STROKE PLAY FORMATS.  (PLAYER DESCRIPTION WILL FOLLOW).  

2.  CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON.  

SKINS

A GAME MADE POPULAR IN RECENT YEARS BY A SPECIAL TOURNAMENT THAT HAS PITTED
HEAD-TO-HEAD:  JACK NICKLAUS, GARY PLAYER, ARNOLD PALMER, LEE TREVINO, AND
FUZZY ZOELLER.  THE RULES ARE SIMILAR TO MATCH PLAY -- YOU HAVE TO WIN A HOLE
OUTRIGHT (NO TIES) -- BUT THE BETTING SYSTEM COMPLETELY CHANGED THE
OBJECTIVE.  INSTEAD OF THE MOST HOLES, YOU TRY TO WIN THE MOST MONEY.  

A DOLLAR AMOUNT IS ASSIGNED TO EACH HOLE.  TYPICALLY, THE FIRST SIX HOLES ARE
WORTH ONE AMOUNT, THE NEXT SIX ARE WORTH TWICE THAT MUCH, AND THE LAST SIX
ARE TRIPLE THE ORIGINAL PRIZE.  THE BEST BALL (LOWEST SCORE ON THE HOLE)
TAKES THE PRIZE.  

IF THE HOLE IS HALVED (TWO OR MORE PLAYERS TIE FOR BEST BALL) THE MONEY FOR
THE HOLE CARRIES OVER TO THE NEXT ONE.  THE MEANS THE MONEY -- AND THE
TENSION -- CAN ADD UP FAST.  IN ONE MEMORABLE SKINS GAMES, GARY PLAYER HAD TO
ROLL IN A 4-FOOT BIRDIE TO WALK AWAY WITH $170,000.  


STROKE PLAY

IN STROKE PLAY, MOST GREAT PLAYERS CONSIDER THE GOLF COURSE TO BE THEIR
OPPOSITION MUCH MORE THAN THEIR FELLOW COMPETITORS.  THAT'S BECAUSE THE GOAL
IS NOT TO WIN HOLES (MATCH PLAY), OR TAKE THE BIG MONEY HOLES (SKINS), BUT TO
SHOOT THE LOWEST SCORE OVER 18 HOLES.  AS JACK PUTS IT: "STROKE PLAY IS AN
18-HOLE GAME, BUT YOU CAN PLAY IT ONLY ONE SHOT AT A TIME."


SELECT YOU PLAYERS

YOU MAKE FIVE DECISIONS ABOUT EACH PLAYER YOU CHOOSE FOR YOU MUCH.  FOR EACH
DECISION:  

  O POINT THE MOUSE AT THE BOX BESIDE YOU DECISION AND CLICK THE MOUSE
     BUTTON.

  O AS YOU COMPLETE EACH PLAYER, POINT TO THE BOX OK TO GO TO NEXT PLAYER,
     AND CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON.

  O AFTER YOUR FINAL SELECTION, POINT AND CLICK ON THE DONE BOX TO GO TO THE
     NEXT SECTION.


SELECT YOUR PLAYERS (CONTINUED)

1.  PLAYER 1 MALE FEMALE

  O THE AVERAGE MALE PLAYER HITS CLUBS LONGER THAN THE AVERAGE FEMALE PLAYER
     -- BUT, OF COURSE, ANYONE CAN MAKE EXTRAORDINARY SHOTS.

2.  COMPUTER PLAYER YES NO

  O CHOOSE FROM NINE DIFFERENT COMPUTER PLAYERS -- FIVE MEN AND FOUR WOMEN
     -- WITH VARIED SKILLS.  (CHECK THE NEXT SECTION FOR COMPLETE
     DESCRIPTIONS)

  O POINT AND CLICK ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT ARROW KEYS WHICH APPEAR NEXT TO
     THE NAME WINDOW TO CYCLE THROUGH THE PLAYERS' NAMES.

  O CHOOSE A NAME, POINT TO THE NEXT OK TO GO TO THE NEXT PLAYER, CLICK ON

     PRESS ENTER


4.  SKILL

  O BEGINNER:  WIND CONDITIONS DON'T AFFECT YOUR SHOTS AS MUCH, AND YOUR
     SLICES AND HOOKS ARE LESS EXTREME.  ON EACH SHOT, YOUR CLUB IS
     AUTOMATICALLY SELECTED FOR YOU.


  O EXPERT:  WIND REALLY COMES INTO PLAY, AND HOOKS AND SLICES ARE MOST
     EXTREME.  IN ADDITION, YOU MUST SELECT YOUR CLUB FOR EACH SHOT.


5.  TEE :  PRO     FARTHEST FROM THE HOLE

           MEN'S   FAR AWAY, BUT NOT AS FAR

           LADIES' CLOSET TO THE HOLE

  NOTE:  SOME HOLES ARE DESIGNED WITH LESS THAN THREE TEES, IN WHICH CASE
         SOME PLAYERS SHARE A TEE.


WHO ARE THESE COMPUTER PLAYERS?

JACK N

     THE GOLDEN BEAR HIMSELF.  NATURALLY, THE PLAYER OF THE CENTURY PLAYS AT
THE EXPERT LEVEL AND HITS FROM THE PRO TEES.  HITS SHOTS ARE CAREFULLY
PLANNED, WELL EXECUTED AND HE HITS THE BALL FURTHER THAN THE POSTED DISTANCE
FOR EACH CLUB.  NICKLAUS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE GOLFERS WHO ALMOST ALWAYS DOES
EXACTLY WHAT HE SET OUT TO DO.

NANCY D

     THOUGH ENTHUSIASTIC, NANCY'S JUST BEGINNING.  SHE OFTEN SUFFERS A WICKED
SLICE ON HER DRIVERS.  AND LONG PUTTS GIVE HER LOTS OF TROUBLE.

LARS X

     CALLS HIMSELF MR. X AND LIKES TO THINK OF HIMSELF AS AN EXPERT -- WHICH
     IS WHY HE DRIVES FROM THE PRO TEES.  HAS A TENDENCY TO HOOK DRIVES AND
     PULL PUTTS TO THE LEFT.

BABS R

     A TRUE COMPETITOR, BABS CONSIDERS HERSELF AN EXPERT.  SHE USUALLY HITS         THE BALL STRAIGHT -- WITH AN OCCASIONAL SLICE.  WHEN IT COMES TO
     PUTTING, SHE'S OVERLY CAUTIOUS, AND FREQUENTLY LEAVES HER PUTTS SHORT.

ART M

     ART'S A WEEKEND GOLFER WHO COULD USE A LITTLE PRACTICE.  HIS SHOTS TEND
     TO BE SHORT BUT STRAIGHT.  AND HIS PUTTS TO BE LONG AND OFF-LINE.

NATASHA

     NATASHA'S A BIG HITTER.  SHE DRIVES FROM THE MEN'S TEES, AND HAS PLAYED
     AT THE EXPERT LEVEL FOR YEARS.  IF SHE DOESN'T SLICE, HER TEE SHOTS ARE
     BEAUTIFUL.  BUT SHE OFTEN LAGS HER PUTTS.

EDDIE C

     HE'S NO JACK NICKLAUS, BUT THIS GUY'S GOOD.  SO GOOD, IN FACT, HE MAKES
     A LIVING SUCKERING PLAYERS INTO A "FRIENDLY" GAME OF SKINS.  NATURALLY
     HE PLAYS AT THE EXPERT LEVEL AND DRIVES FROM THE PRO TEES.

SALLY C

     THOUGH SHE'S BEEN PLAYING FOR YEARS, SALLY IS STILL A BEGINNER.  SHE
     JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET THE SWING OF IT.  SHE HITS FROM THE LADIES' TEES.
     HER DRIVES COULD GO EITHER WAY -- HOOK OR SLICE.  AND SHE LEAVES HE
     PUTTS SHORT.

CURLY O

     CURLY JUST TOOK UP GOLFING THIS YEAR AND LOVES IT.  PROBLEM IS, HE
     DOESN'T REALLY PLAY THAT WELL.  HE SHOOTS FROM THE MEN'S TEES, AND PLAYS
     AT THE BEGINNER'S LEVEL.  HIS SLICES COULD END UP JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE.
     SO COULD HIS PUTTS.

GAMEPLAY -- TEE TO GREEN

OVERHEAD VIEWS OF EACH HOLE

AN OVERHEAD VIEW OF EACH HOLE APPEARS BEFORE YOU TEE OFF.  IT GIVES YOU BASIC
DATA -- COURSE NAME, HOLE NUMBER, PAR, DISTANCE, FROM EACH TEE -- AS WELL AS
A DETAILED LOOK AT THE LAYOUT.  1.  STUDY THE HOLE.  JACK EXCELS AT THIS;
SO CAN YOU.

     O  PAR ATTENTION TO THE PIN PLACEMENT.  IT'S RANDOM WHICH CHANGES THE
        LENGTH AND CHARACTER OF THE HOLE EVERY TIME YOU PLAY IT

     O  ANALYZE THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS -- DOGLEGS, TREES, WATER, TRAPS, OUT OF
        BOUNDS, CART PATHS -- THEN IDENTIFY THE OPTIMUM TARGET AREAS FOR YOUR
        SHOTS.

     O  JACK PUTS IT THIS WAY:  "THERE IS AN IDEAL ROUTE FOR PLAYING EVERY
        GOLF HOLE EVER BUILT, AND THE MORE PRECISELY YOU CAN IDENTIFY IT, THE
        GREATER YOUR CHANCES FOR SUCCESS'

2.  CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED TO TEE OFF.

3.  PRESS THE LETTER O ANYTIME DURING THE HOLE TO RETURN TO THIS OVERHEAD
    VIEW.

A TIP FROM JACK...

THE OVERHEAD VIEW CAN HELP YOU BE A SMARTER SKINS PLAYER BECAUSE IT SHOWS YOU
THE RELATIVE LOCATIONS OF EVERY BALL THAT'S PLAYED.  USE IT TO COMPARE YOUR
NEXT SHOT TO WHAT YOUR OPPONENTS MUST FACE.  THE INFORMATION WILL TELL YOU
WHETHER TO PLAY SAFE, OR GO FOR IT.  "A DEFINITE TIME TO BE CONSERVATIVE IN
A SKINS GAME IS WHEN YOUR OPPONENT, HITTING FIRST, FINDS SERIOUS TROUBLE SUCH
AS OUT-OF-BOUNDS," SAYS JACK.  "SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND PLAY IT COZY. 

CONVERSELY, IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE AND HE'S OBVIOUSLY IN A-1 SHAPE, THERE'S
LITTLE TO BE LOST BY GAMBLING." CHOOSE YOUR CLUBS 1.  BEGINNER

     O  A CLUB IS AUTOMATICALLY SELECTED FOR YOU ON EACH SHOT FROM TEE TO
        GREEN.  IT APPEARS IN THE CLUB SELECTION BOX AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT OF
        YOUR SCREEN, ALONG WITH THE POSTED MAXIMUM DISTANCE FOR THAT CLUB.

     O  THE COMPUTER CALCULATED YOUR YARDAGE FROM THE PIN, THEN SELECTS THE
        CLUB WHOSE POSTED MAXIMUM DISTANCE (SEE THE CLUB DISTANCE CHART ON
        THE BACK COVER) IS CLOSET TO THAT YARDAGE.

     O  BE CAREFUL:  THE COMPUTER ONLY TAKES DISTANCE INTO CONSIDERATION --
        NOT WIND, TREES, ROUGH OR OTHER CONDITIONS WHICH CAN AFFECT CLUB
        SELECTION.

     O  YOU CAN OVERRIDE THE COMPUTER'S CHOICE BY POINTING AND CLICKING ON
        THE UP AND DOWN ARROWS BESIDE THE SELECTED CLUB.  STOP WHEN THE CLUB
        OF YOUR CHOICE APPEARS:

                    EIGHT IRONS                   (2-9)
                    TWO FAIRWAY WOODS             (3-4)
                    ONE PITCHING WEDGE            (P-WEDGE)
                    ONE SAND WEDGE                (S-WEDGE)
                    ONE DRIVER


YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE A MOUSE

YOU CAN ALSO USE THE KEYBOARD TO CONTROL AIMING AND SWINGING, BUT FOR SAKE OF
BREVITY WE OMIT THOSE INSTRUCTIONS THROUGHOUT.  USE THE LEFT AND RIGHT ARROW
KEYS TO AIM THE SHOT, THE UP AND DOWN ARROW KEYS TO MAKE YOUR CLUB SELECTION,
AND THE SPACE BAR TO REPLACE THE CLICKING OF THE MOUSE. 2.  EXPERT

     O  YOU MUST SELECT YOUR OWN CLUBS FOR EACH SHOT; THE CLUB SELECTION BOX
        DEFAULTS TO THE LAST CLUB YOU USED UNTIL YOU SELECT ANOTHER STICK

     O  THE COMPUTER AUTOMATICALLY DEFAULTS TO THE SAND WEDGE IN THE SAND,
        THE PUTTER ON THE GREEN, AND THE DRIVER ON THE TEE; BUT IT WON'T
        DEFAULT TO THE DRIVER OFF THE TEE.

     O  BASE YOUR DECISION ON THE YARDAGE TO THE PIN -- AS SHOWN ON THE
        BOTTOM CENTER OF THE SCREEN -- AND OTHER PLAYING CONDITIONS SUCH AS
        WIND, HAZARDS AND ROUGH.

     O  CHECK THE CLUB SELECTION CHART ON THE BACK COVER TO SEE THE MAXIMUM
        DISTANCE EACH CLUB CAN BE HIT WITHOUT OVERSWINGING (NO YARDAGE
        APPEARS IN THE CLUB SELECTION BOX)

     O  IF YOU DON'T SELECT A CLUB, THE COMPUTER SELECTS EITHER THE LAST CLUB
        YOU USED (EXCEPT THE DRIVER), OR THE SAND WEDGE OR PUTTER IF YOU'RE
        IN THE SAND OR ON THE GREEN.

A TIP FROM JACK...

CLUB SELECTION IS WIDE OPEN IN THIS GAME EXCEPT FOR THREE EXCEPTIONS:  YOUR
DRIVER CAN ONLY BE HIT FROM THE TEE, YOUR PUTTER CAN ONLY BE HIT FROM THE
GREEN, AND THE SAND WEDGE CAN ONLY BE HIT FROM A SAND TRAP.  BUT BEFORE YOU
SELECT ANY CLUB, PREPARE FOR YOUR SHOT MENTALLY.  "BEFORE EVERY SHOT, LOOK
HARD AT WHAT CONFRONTS YOU AND THEN DECIDE ON A CLUB, AND TARGET, "JACK SAYS.
"IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC RISKS -- OUT-OF-BOUNDS, WATER, BUNKER, HEAVY ROUGH,
WIND, GROUND SLOPE, PIN PLACEMENT -- AND WEIGH THEM AGAINST YOUR
CAPABILITIES." AIMING YOUR SHOTS ATOP THE PLAY SCREEN, A SMALL FLAGSTICK
ALWAYS INDICATES WHERE THE PIN IS LOCATED IN RELATION TO YOUR POSITION. 
(THIS IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL ON BLIND SHOTS WHERE HILLS OR TREES OBSTRUCT YOUR
VIEW OF THE REAL FLAG.) 1.  POINT AND CLICK ON THE ARROW KEYS BESIDE AIM SHOT
TO ADJUST THE "AIMING BALL" TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF THE SMALL FLAG.  (OR,
YOU CAN POINT TO
     THE AIMING BALL, CLICK AND HOLD THE MOUSE BUTTON, AND "DRAG" THE BALL TO
     YOUR DESIRED LOCATION.)

2.   PLACE THE AIMING BALL DIRECTLY OVER THE FLAG IF YOU WANT TO AIM YOUR
     SHOT DIRECTLY AT THE PIN.

3.   PLACE THE BALL TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT OF THE FLAG TO COMPENSATE FOR WIND
     CONDITIONS, OBSTRUCTING HAZARDS, HOOKS AND SLICES, AND FOR THE BREAK ON
     PUTTS.


CHANGING YOUR PERSPECTIVE

IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE DIRECTION YOU'RE AIMING TOWARD -- SAY A TREE BLOCKS
YOUR SHOT -- YOU CAN CHANGE IT:  1.  POINT AND CLOCK ON THE ARROW KEYS
BESIDE AIM SHOT TO SLIDE THE AIMING
     BALL PAST EITHER OF THE TWO VERTICAL PEGS THAT BOOKEND THE TOP OF THE
     SCREEN.  (OR, YOU CAN POINT TO THE AIMING BALL, CLOCK AND HOLD THE MOUSE
     BUTTON, AND "DRAG" THE BALL PAST THE PEGS.)

2.   SLIDE IT PAST THE LEFT PEG:  THE SCREEN AUTOMATICALLY REDRAWS AND YOU
     NOW SEE WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IF YOU HAD PHYSICALLY SHIFTED YOUR VISION TO
     THE LEFT.

3.   SLIDE IT PAST THE RIGHT PEG:  IT CAUSES THE SAME SHIFT OF PERSPECTIVE,
     BUT TO THE RIGHT.

4.   IF YOU WANT, YOU CAN CONTINUE TO SCROLL RIGHT OR LEFT AND SEE A 360
     DEGREE VIEW OF THE HOLE FROM WHERE YOU'RE STANDING.


A TIP FROM JACK...

THIS FEATURE CAN BE USED ANYTIME, BUT IT'S ESPECIALLY HELPFUL BETWEEN THE TEE
AND GREEN WHERE YOU'RE DECIDING WHETHER TO GAMBLE OR NOT GAMBLE.  IT'S OFTEN
BETTER TO SHIRT TROUBLE THAN TO ALWAYS AIM FOR THE PIN ON YOUR APPROACH
SHOTS.  IT'S USUALLY HIGHER HANDICAPPERS WHO DON'T PLAY AWAY FROM OBVIOUS
DANGERS -- BUNKERS, TREES, WATERS, ETC.  "UNLESS YOU ARE FORCED BY THE
COMPETITIVE SITUATION TO GAMBLE, " JACK SAYS.  "I LEAN TOWARD PLAYING SAFE
AND MOVING ON.  IT'S PAID OFF FOR ME -- ESPECIALLY ON THE TOUGH COURSED USED
IN MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIPS." SWINGING  THE MOVEMENT OF THE POWER BAR ON
THE LEFT OF THE SCREEN CORRESPONDS DIRECTLY WITH YOUR PLAYERS' SWING ON
SCREEN.  TO CONTROL THE SWING, YOU CONTROL THE POWER BAR.  AND TO CONTROL THE
POWER BAR, YOU USE THE MOUSE.  EVERY SHOT REQUIRED THREE CLICKS OF THE
MOUSE BUTTON TO EXECUTE.  (THE MOUSE POINTER MUST BE INSIDE THE GOLF COURSE
PORTION OF THE SCREEN TO MAKE IT WORK.) THE TIMING OF THE CLICKS DETERMINES
HOW HARD AND HOW STRAIGHT YOU CAN HIT THE BALL.  1.  CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON
ONCE TO BEGIN YOUR BACKSWING.  2.  CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON A SECOND TIME TO
CONTROL THE DISTANCE OF YOUR SHOT
    (AND START YOUR DOWNSWING.)

3.  CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON A FINAL TIME TO STRIKE THE BALL -- AND CONTROL HOW
    FAR LEFT OR RIGHT OF STRAIGHT YOU WANT TO HIT IT.


"SWINGING" THE POWER BAR

THE MIDDLE SECTION OF THE POWER BAR -- LET'S CALL IT THE SWING ZONE -- IS
DIVIDED INTO TEN SEGMENTS, EACH OF WHICH REPRESENTS 10% OF YOUR CLUB'S
POTENTIAL DISTANCE (AS DETERMINED BY THE CLUB DISTANCE CHART, AND AS SHOWN IN
THE CLUB SELECTION BOX.)  THUS, THE BOTTOM LINE OF THE SWING ZONE
REPRESENTS 0% OR 0 DISTANCE; THE TOP LINE REPRESENTS 100%, OR THE MAXIMUM
DISTANCE FOR EACH CLUB AS SET BY THE COMPUTER; AND THE HALF LINE REPRESENTS
50% OR HALF THAT MAXIMUM DISTANCE.   A SAMPLE SHOT:  YOU'RE SANDING ON
THE TEE OF A 300-YARD HOLE, SO YOU TAKE YOUR DRIVER AND YOU WANT TO HIT IT
FULL.  IF YOU'RE A MAN, A FULL DRIVER, MEANS 250 YARDS IN THIS GAME.  YOU
DECIDE TO HIT IT DEAD STRAIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE HOLE GOES, AND
THERE'S NO OFFENDING WIND OF HAZARDS.  1.  CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON TO START
YOUR BACKSWING; A COLOR RISES LIKE
     MERCURY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SWING ZONE TOWARDS THE 100% LINE.

2.  WATCH THE RISE CAREFULLY.  TRY TO CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON THE MOMENT IT
    REACHES THE 100% LINE.

     O  A TRIANGULAR ARROW TO THE LEFT OF THE POWER BAR INDICATES EXACTLY
        WHERE YOU MAKE YOUR CLICK.

     O   AFTER THE CLICK, THE COLOR DESCENDS, JUST LIKE YOUR BACKSWING.

3.   TO KEEP YOUR SHOT STRAIGHT ON TARGET (THE FLAGSTICK), MAKE YOURS THIRD
     CLICK ON THE '0' LINE.

     O    ANOTHER ARROW APPEARS TO MARK YOUR CLICK.

4.   IF EACH CLICK IS RIGHT ON THE BUTTON, YOUR BALL SAILS 250 YEARS STRAIGHT
     DOWN THE FAIRWAY, AND YOU'RE LEFT WITH A 50-YARD APPROACH SHOT TO THE
     GREEN.

     O  THE COMPUTER AUTOMATICALLY TELLS YOU HOW FAR YOU HIT YOUR LAST SHOT.


CONTROLLING YOUR DISTANCE

OF COURSE, YOU DON'T HIT EVERY CLUB FULL IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN BOUNDS. 
LET'S CONTINUE THE SAMPLE HOLE TO SEE HOW TO CONTROL THE DISTANCE OF YOUR
SHOTS.  YOU'RE 50 YARDS FROM THE PIN, SO YOU SELECT YOUR PITCHING WEDGE (P-
WEDGE) BECAUSE THE CHART SAYS THE PITCHING WEDGE CAN WHACK IT 100 YARDS IF
YOU HIT IT FULL.  BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO HIT IT FULL; YOU WANT TO HIT HALF A
WEDGE 50 YARDS:  1.  CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON TO START YOUR SWING.
     O  NOTICE THAT THE COLOR RISES MUCH MORE SLOWLY WITH A WEDGE THAN IT
        DOES WITH ANY OTHER CLUB.

     O  THE SMALLER THE CLUB, THE SLOWER THE RISE -- BECAUSE THE MOST HUMANS
        SMALLER CLUBS (LIKE THE HIGH IRONS) ARE EASIER TO HIT THAN BIG ONES
        (DRIVERS AND FAIRWAYS WOODS)

2.  CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON THE MOMENT THE RISING COLOR REACHES THE HALF LINE
    -- THAT'S 50% OF THE WEDGE'S FULL DISTANCE (100 YARDS) OR 50 YARDS.

     O  REMEMBER THAT EACH LINE IN THE SWING ZONE REPRESENTS 10 PERCENT OF
        ANY CLUB'S POSTED MAXIMUM DISTANCE

3.  AS THE COLOR DESCENDS, MAKE YOUR FINAL CLICK RIGHT ON THE BOTTOM LINE OF
    THE SWING ZONE TO HIT THE BALL STRAIGHTAWAY.

    THE BALL SHOULD LOOP GENTLY 50 YARDS INTO THE AIR THAN NESTLE ONTO THE
    GREEN -- INCHES FROM THE CUP.


OVERSWINGING AND UNDERSNG

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T MAKE YOUR SECOND, OR DISTANCE, CLICK DIRECTLY ON
THE 100% LINE OF THE SWING ZONE?  1.  IF YOU MAKE THE SECOND CLICK LATE --
INSIDE THE POWER SWING ZONE -- YOU
    OVERSWING.

     O  THAT MEANS YOUR SHOT CAN CARRY LONGER THAN THE POSTED MAXIMUM
        DISTANCE OF YOUR CLUB

     O  IT ALSO MEANS THAT IF YOU MISJUDGE YOUR THIRD, OR ACCURACY, CLICK,
        THE RESULTING HOOK OR SLICE IS RANDOMLY EXAGGERATED.

2.  IF YOU'RE EARLY ON THE SECOND CLICK -- BENEATH THE 100% LINE OF THE SWING
    ZONE -- YOU UNDERSWING.

     O  THAT MEANS THE DISTANCE OF YOUR SHOT WILL BE SOME PERCENTAGE LESS
        THAN THE FULL POSTED DISTANCE OF YOUR CLUB

     O  HOW MUCH LESS DEPENDS ON HOW EARLY YOU MAKE YOUR CLICK -- THE EARLIER
        THE CLICK, THE SHORTER YOUR HIT


A TIP FROM JACK...

OVERSWINGING AND UNDERSWINGING ARE NOT NECESSARILY BAD.  IT DEPENDS ON THE
SITUATION.  YOU HAVE TO UNDERSWING ON SOME SHOTS -- FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU
HAVE A 6-FOOT PUTT AND YOU'RE HOLDING A PUTTER WITH AN 80-FOOT RANGE.  AND
ACCURACY ISN'T SACRIFICED BY UNDERSWINGING, JUST DISTANCE.  OVERSWINGING'S
ANOTHER STORY.  IT CAN REALLY HURT YOU IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.  ITS TAKES A
PREFECT THIRD CLICK TO AVOID A MAJOR SLICE OR HOOK IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.  SAYS
JACK: "YOU'LL HIT THE BALL STRAIGHTER AND MORE SOLIDLY WHEN YOU DON'T
MENTALLY PRESSURE YOURSELF TO PRODUCE ABSOLUTE PERFECTION AND "PRESS" EVERY
CLUB FOR ITS MAXIMUM DISTANCE.  TAKE ONE MORE CLUB THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED
FOR EVERY APPROACH SHOT AND SWING NORMALLY." ON THE OTHER HAND, A BIG HIT
SOMETIMES, OFFERS THE BETTER GOLFER A FIND OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN A COMPETITIVE
EDGE.  "A PREFECT EXAMPLE IS THE 15TH AT AUGUSTA NATIONALS," SAYS JACK. 
"ALMOST EVERYONE CUTS LOOSE HERE BECAUSE THE REWARD CAN BE A SHOT AT THE
GREEN WITH AN IRON FOR A TWO-PUTT BIRDIE." HOOKING AND SLICING  IF
THERE'S NO WIND AND IF YOU MAKE YOUR THIRD, OR ACCURACY, CLICK RIGHT ON THE
BOTTOM LINE OF THE SWING ZONE, THE BALL SHOULD FLY STRAIGHT.  BUT JUST AS YOU
CAN'T HIT EVERY CLUB FULL, IT'S UNLIKELY THAT YOU CAN HIT EVERY SHOT
STRAIGHT.  AND SOMETIMES YOU DON'T WANT TO HIT IT STRAIGHT. 1.  HOW TO HIT
A HOOK, SO THAT IT "DRAWS" THE BALL TO THE LEFT (FOR A
     RIGHT-HANDED GOLFER):

     O  AFTER YOUR SECOND, OR DISTANCE, CLICK, THE COLOR DESCENDS TOWARD THE
        BOTTOM LINE OF THE SWING ZONE.

     O  CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON BEFORE THE COLOR REACHES THE BOTTOM LINE -- IN
        OTHER WORDS, SWING EARLY -- AND YOUR SHOT HOOKS TO THE LEFT.

     O  HOW FAR IT HOOKS DEPENDS UPON HOW EARLY YOU SWING (THE EARLIER THE
        SWING, THE BIGGER THE HOOK), AND HOW HARD YOU SWING (IF YOU OVERSWING
        INTO THE POWER SWING ZONE, THE HOOK IS RANDOMLY EXAGGERATED)

2.   HOW TO HIT A SLICE THAT "FADES" THE BALL TO THE RIGHT (FOR A
     RIGHT-HANDED GOLFER):

     O  AFTER YOUR SECOND, OR DISTANCE, CLICK, THE COLOR DESCENDS TOWARD THE
        BOTTOM LINE OF THE SWING ZONE.

     O  CLICK THE MOUSE BUTTON AFTER THE COLOR REACHES THE BOTTOM LINE -- IN
        OTHER WORDS, SWING LATE -- AND YOUR SHOT SLICES TO THE RIGHT.

     O  HOW FAR IT SLICES DEPENDS UPON HOW LATE YOU SWING (THE LATER THE
        SWING, THE BIGGER THE SLICE), AND HOW HARD YOU SWING (IF YOU
        OVERSWING INTO THE POWER SWING ZONE, THE SLICE IS RANDOMLY
        EXAGGERATED)

A TIP FROM JACK...

THE "ABILITY" TO HOOK AND SLICE CAN DESTROY A HOLE OR AN ENTIRE ROUND, BUT
WITH A LITTLE STRATEGY, TECHNIQUE AND PRACTICE THEY CAN GIVE YOU A MAJOR
ADVANTAGE OVER YOUR OPPONENT.  "LET'S SAY I'M PLAYING A 5-IRON SHOT TO A
GREEN 80 FEET WIDE WITH THE PIN CENTRALLY LOCATED," SAYS JACK.  "IF I AIM AT
THE PIN AND ATTEMPT TO HIT STRAIGHT, I HAVE ONLY 40 FEET OF GREEN TO WORK
WITH IF I HOOK OR SLICE THE SHOT."  "BUT BY AIMING, SAYS 20 FEET TO THE
LEFT OR RIGHT OF THE PIN AND TRYING TO FACE OR DRAW THE BALL IN TOWARD IT, I
GIVE MYSELF A MUCH GREATER MARGIN FOR ERROR.  NOW I CAN "MISS" THE SHOT BY 40
FEET AND STILL KEEP THE BALL WITHIN 20 FEET OF THE HOLE."  "THAT IS THE
TACTICAL REASON GOOD GOLFERS RARELY TRY TO HIT THE BALL DEAD STRAIGHT.  THE
TECHNICAL REASON IS THAT A STRAIGHT SHOT IS MUCH HARDER TO KEEP REPEATING
THAN A FADE OR DRAW."  HAZARDS AND COURSE CONDITIONS  YOUR SWING ISN'T
THE ONLY VARIABLE YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER (OR OVERCOME) WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO
HIT THE BALL STRAIGHT.  WIND  TECHNICALLY NOT A HAZARD ITSELF, WIND CAN
CERTAINLY HELP YOU FIND THE LEGITIMATE ONES IN A HURRY.  THE AMOUNT AND
DIRECTION OF THE WIND THAT AFFECTS EACH SHOT IS REGISTERED ON A CIRCULAR WIND
GAUGE AT THE LOWER LEFT OF YOUR SCREEN.  WIND DIRECTION
     O  IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE STANDING IN THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE, FACING
        STRAIGHT AHEAD AT THE FLAGSTICK

     O  THE LINE INSIDE THE CIRCLE IS THE WIND

     O  NOW IMAGINE THERE'S AN ARROW ON THAT LINE AIMING AWAY FROM YOU --
        THAT'S THE DIRECTION THE WIND IS BLOWING.

WIND SPEED

     O  A BAR GAUGE LABELED WIND -- BELOW THE DIRECTION CIRCLE -- TELLS YOU
        HOW HARD THE WIND IS BLOWING.

     O  THE INDICATOR IS A RED BAR WHICH SLIDES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT ON THE
        GAUGE:  0 MPH ON THE LEFT, 10 MPH IN THE CENTER, 20 MPH ON THE RIGHT.


A TIP FROM JACK...

"YOU NEED INTELLIGENCE AND PATIENCE TO PLAY WELL IN WIND," JACK SAYS, "BUT
MOST OF ALL YOU NEED TO STRONG SENSE OF REALISM AND SURE EMOTIONAL CONTROL. 
PAR CLIMBS FOR ALL GOLFERS ALONG WITH WIND FORCE."


TAILWINDS

A FOLLOWING WIND MAKES IT HARDER TO STOP THE BALL IN THE FAIRWAY OR ON THE
GREEN, SO CLUB YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY.  JACK: "I TAKE ONE OR TWO CLUBS LESS
THAN THE DISTANCE WOULD NORMALLY REQUIRE AND HIT HARD.  DON'T EVER "BABY" A
SHOT WHEN YOU WANT HEIGHT -- GIVE IT A GOOD, SOLID WHACK."


HEADWINDS

OBVIOUSLY, YOU NEED A COMPENSATE FOR A STRONG HEADWIND BY SWINGING HARDER OR
USING MORE CLUB.  "YOUR GOAL ANY TIME YOU'RE FIRING DEAD INTO A STRONG WIND,"
SAYS JACK, "SHOULD BE A LOW, BORING FLIGHT.  TO MINIMIZE SOARING YOU MUST
MINIMIZE BACKSPIN, AND YOU'LL DO THAT MOST EFFECTIVELY BY PLAYING THE BALL
FROM RIGHT TO LEFT, RATHER THAN STRAIGHT OR FROM LEFT TO RIGHT."


CROSSWINDS

JACK: "YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS WHENEVER THE WIND IS FULLY OR PARTIALLY ACROSS
THE LINE OF A SHOT.  ONE IS TO HOOK OR SLICE AGAINST THE DIRECTION OF THE
WIND, THUS "HOLDING" THE BALL MORE OR LESS STRAIGHT.  THE OTHER OPTION IS
SIMPLY TO AIM AS MUCH OFF THE DIRECT LINES AS YOU THINK THE WIND WILL MOVE
THE BALL AND PLAY YOUR NORMAL SHOT, ALLOWING THE BALL TO BE BLOWN BACK TO THE
TARGET."


ROUGH

USE MORE CLUB OR MORE POWER TO HIT OUT OF THE LONGER, THICKER GRASS THAT
BORDERS THE MANICURED FAIRWAYS.

SAND TRAPS

LIKE THE ROUGH, YOU NEED MORE POWER OR MORE CLUB TO GET DISTANCE FROM A
FAIRWAY BUNKER.

WATER AND OUT-OF-BOUNDS

HITTING INTO THE WATER COSTS YOU A ONE-STROKE PENALTY, AND THE COMPUTER GIVES
YOU THE OPTION OF HITTING THE BALL AGAIN FROM THE SAME LOCATION OR DROPPING
THE BALL NEAR THE WATER (BUT NO CLOSER TO THE HOLE).

CART PATH

IT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION WHETHER OR NOT A CART PATH IS HAZARDOUS OR NOT. 
THE BALL BOUNCES HIGHER AND FARTHER OFF OF IT, WHICH MAY BE DESIRABLE ON A
TROUBLE-FREE DRIVE.  BUT ON SOME SHOTS, THE CAROM CAN CARRY YOU RIGHT OUT-OF-
BOUNDS.


PUTTING

YOU CAN ONLY HIT THE PUTTER ON GREENS, AND YOU USE THE SAME TECHNIQUE TO AIM
AND STROKE A PUTT AS YOU USE TO HIT ANY CLUB.

AIMING AND STROKING

1.  IMAGINE AN INVISIBLE STRAIGHT LINES THAT CONNECTS YOUR BALL, THE HOLE,
    AND THE AIMING BALL AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN.

2.  POINT AND CLICK ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT ARROWS BESIDE AIM SHOT TO MOVE THE
    AIMING BALL ONTO THE END OF THAT IMAGINARY LINE.  (OR, POINT TO THE
    AIMING BALL, CLICK AND HOLD THE MOUSE BUTTON AND "DRAG" THE BALL THERE.)

3.  USE THE THREE-CLICK PROCEDURE ON THE POWER BAR TO CONTROL THE DISTANCE
    AND DIRECTION OF YOUR STROKE.

     O  REMEMBER THAT THE MAXIMUM DISTANCE ON YOUR PUTTER IS 80 FEET, THUS
        EVERY SEGMENT ON THE POWER BAR REPRESENTS 8 FEET.

READING THE BREAK

UNFORTUNATELY, MANY GREENS AREN'T FLAT, SO YOUR PUTTER WON'T ALWAYS GO
STRAIGHT.  TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH A PUTT IS GOING TO BREAK RIGHT OR LEFT, OR IF
YOU'RE PUTTING UPHILL OR DOWNHILL, CHECK THE BREAK INDICATOR.  IT'S IN THE
SAME LOCATION AS THE WIND GAUGE AND OPERATES, IN A SIMILAR WAY.

RIGHT, LEFT, UPHILL, DOWNHILL?

1.   IMAGINE THAT THE LINE IN THE CIRCLE HAS AN ARROW ON IT POINTING OUTWARDS
     -- THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT THE PUTT WILL BREAK (RIGHT OR LEFT) IF
     YOU'RE AIMING DIRECTLY AT THE HOLE.

     O  IF THERE'S NO LINE, THERE'S NO BREAK.

2.   IF THE ARROW POINTS DUE SOUTH AS ON A COMPASS, THAT MEANS THAT THE PUTT
     IS UPHILL AND HAS NO BREAK.

     O  UPHILL PUTTS ARE SLOW' MAKE A FIRM STROKE.

3.   IF THE ARROW POINTS DUE NORTH, THE PUTT IS STRAIGHT DOWNHILL.

     O  DOWNHILL PUTTS ARE FAST; EASE UP ON THE MALLET.

4.  IF THE LINE POINTS, SAY, NORTHEAST, THAT MEANS YOU PUTT IS UPHILL AND IT
    BREAKS TO THE RIGHT.  COMPENSATE FOR BOTH FACTORS.

HOW MUCH DOES IT BREAK?

     O  A BAR GAUGE LABELED BREAK -- BELOW THE DIRECTION CIRCLE -- TELLS YOU
        THE INTENSITY OF A PUTT'S BREAK.

     O  THE INDICATOR IS A RED BAR WHICH SLIDES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT ON THE
        GAUGE:  IF AT THE FAR LEFT (NO COLOR), THE BREAK IS VIRTUALLY
        NON-EXISTENT; IF AT THE FAR RIGHT, YOU HAVE A MAJOR BREAK.


A TIP FROM JACK...

"THE AMOUNT ANY PUTT BREAKS DEPENDS ON ITS SPEED," SAYS JACK.  "THE HARDER
YOU HIT IT, LESS THE BREAK WILL ALTER ITS COURSE.  THIS IS GOOD TO REMEMBER,
ESPECIALLY ON SHORT PUTTS WHEN YOU'RE UNDER PRESSURE.  THE GREATER THE
PRESSURE YOU'RE UNDER, THE BETTER OFF YOU ARE PLAYING BOLDLY RATHER THAN
CUTELY ON "MUST" SHORT PUTTS."

STRATEGY

     O  BE AS ACCURATE AS YOU CAN ON YOUR SECOND, OR DISTANCE, CLOCK ON THE
        POWER BAR.  IF YOU GO PAST YOUR TARGET, YOUR SHOOT WILL BE LONG.

     O  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE POWER BAR (BUT WATCH OTHER PLAYERS WHEN THEY'RE
        HITTING -- THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT!)

     O  USE AN IRON, NOT A WOOD, WHEN HITTING FROM THE SAND OR ROUGH.

     O  IF YOU'RE SHOOTING FROM HEAVY ROUGH, TAKE TWO MORE CLUBS THAN YOU
        NORMALLY USE.

     O  WHEN IN DOUBT, OR YOU NEED A KNOW YOUR KEY COMMANDS, PRESS "H" FOR
        HELP!

     O  IT'S NOT EASY, BUT YOU CAN BEAT THE COMPUTER JACK NICKLAUS.  ONE
        ADVANTAGE YOU HAVE OVER HIM IS THAT YOU CAN HIT THE BALL LONGER THAN
        HE DOES (THAT'S ALL WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU).

     O  PUTTING:  REMEMBER THAT THE BREAK INDICATOR ONLY TELLS YOU THE
        DIRECTION OF THE BREAK WHEN YOU AIM DIRECTLY AT THE HOLE.  IF YOU HIT
        THE BALL TOO FAR, OR TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT, THE SLOPE OF THE GREEN --
        AND HENCE THE BREAK -- WILL CHANGE.
