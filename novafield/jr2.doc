   JR-Edit is an external phonebook editor for use with JR-Comm 1.0.  It
gives you the ability to import JR-Comm 0.94a .def, .macros and .phones
files for conversion to JR-Comm 1.0 format.  JR-Edit also provides you
with an import facility to convert files that are in "The Final List"(tm)
format.  Lastly, you can print, globally edit and/or append JR-Comm 1.0
phonebook files.

   The program itself is basically the same user interface that exists in
JR-Comm with a few changes and additions.  For this reason, the majority of
operation of the various parameter requesters used in JR-Edit will not be
discussed here.  Only those features that deviate from JR-Comm operation or
are unique to JR-Edit will be described in this document.  Consult the JR-Comm
1.0 Users Manual for desciptions of the various parameter requesters and other
related functions.



START-UP
--------

   JR-Edit begins by searching and loading the the defaults files in the same
exact sequence as JR-Comm, it will NOT load files that are other than 1.0
format.  JR-Edit is considered to be primarily an external editor for JR-Comm
1.0, not a converter for other format files even though it does contain these
functions.

   Once loaded, JR-Edit will exist on a 16 color custom screen with the
phonebook requester permanently open.  The 16 color screen is required so
that you may edit the color palette for *any* type screen without JR-Edit
requiring the necessary logic to convert to the proper screen type prior
to accessing the color palette requester.



DEFAULT PARAMETERS
------------------

   As with JR-Comm, JR-Edit will resort to the same exact set of default
parameter settings if a jrcomm.def file was not found.  So, you may want
to create your jrcomm.def file with JR-Edit prior to running JR-Comm for
the first time.

   Although the phonebook requester is always open, you can still change
the default parameters by opening the respective requester via the items
in the OPTIONS menu.  It is recommended that you set them prior to doing
a 0.94a or TFL import operation so that all the new entries created as a
result inherit the settings that are not explicitly set during the import
itself.

   A menu item in the PROJECT menu is provided to import and convert a 0.94a
.def file.  You will still have to do quite a bit of setting on your own due
to the new options that did not exist in JR-Comm 0.94a after completing the
import operation.  It was included primarily for completness.

   You will HAVE to import 0.94a format .macros files as well due to a few
differences in macros format and file structure.  A simple read/write 
procedure will provide you with conversion "in place" to JR-Comm 1.0.  Refer
to chapter 11 of the JR-Comm Users Manual for information of the new macro
escapes that are available in JR-Comm 1.0.



IMPORTING 0.94a phonebook files
-------------------------------

   The selection gadget labeled "IMPORT" is used for both 0.94a and TFL
format files, only 0.94a files will be discussed in this section, refer
to the next section for TFL files.

   Selecting this gadget will open the JR-Comm file requester so that you
may select the desired 0.94a phonebook file and closing the file
requester via the "OK" gadget you are now presented with the IMPORT
selection requester, select 0.94a.

   All phonebook entries will be imported and converted to 1.0 format.
The options new to 1.0 that were in effect when you imported the 0.94a
phonebook will be passed on to each entry.  You can now edit each entry
individually or with the global edit function described below.



IMPORTING TFL phonebook files
-----------------------------

   The same sequence of operations are used to select and import a TFL
format phonebook.  As with the 0.94a phonebook import function, current
settings in effect will be copied to each phonebook entry created during
the conversion.  Since little information in a TFL phone entry is related
to JR-Comm, almost all the options for each entry will reflect the current
settings of JR-Edit.  Please make sure that everything is set the way you
want it to be before you import a TFL file.

   The following data are extracted from a TFL phone entry:


   Item        Column position   # of chars     Details
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Name        1                 15             (all info copied)
   Phone #     20                16             (trailing alphas removed)
   Baud        37                5              (max)
   Duplex      43                1              (Full or Half)
   Data len.   44                1              (7 or 8)
   Parity      45                1              (Even, Odd or None)
   Stop bits   46                1              (1 or 2)
   

   Since JR-Edit does not contain any sort of search or matching features,
you may want to edit a raw TFL file with a text editor into multiple files
so that you can adjust the default settings (terminal emulation and protocol
being the most common) for each group of entries that you want to import.



PRINT
-----

   JR-Edit provides you with a hardcopy print feature.  It does not print
out every setting of a phonebook entry however, only the most important
ones in the following format:

Name  PhoneNumber  Password
Baud Duplex BitsParityStop Emulation CRxlate LFxlate EOLout protocol

example:

Dynalogic BBS 1-609-625-2453 mypw
2400 F 8N1 IBM Color CRN LFN CR ZMODEM



APPEND
------

   This function will append another JR-Comm 1.0 format phonebook to the
current one.  The LOAD function clears the current phonebook prior to
loading a new one.



SELECT & UNSELECT
-----------------

   Works as expected.  Select all or unselect all entries in the phonebook.



GLOBAL
------

   The global editor enables you to set selected entries to settings of
your choosing.  This mode can quickly get you into trouble, so save a
copy of the phonebook to an alternate file prior to making any changes.

   The first step is to select the entries that you wish to globally
edit.  Now select the GLOBAL gadget.

   You are now greeted with the PHONE ENTRY EDITOR requester, notice that
the string gadgets for name, phone number, capture file, macros file and
password are missing.  You cannot globally edit these portions of each
entry.

   The following actions are applied to every selected entry in the PHONE
ENTRY EDIT requester:

       Length:  If zero, no effect.  Used otherwise.
    Cents/min:  Same as Length.
  Dial Prefix:  If all are "off", no effect.  Selected otherwise.
Password type:  Same as for Dial Prefix.
  Reset Timer:  Each entry will be set to the state of this option, off or on.

   Notice that the "mutually excluded" gadget sets (for example, the Dial
Prefix group), are all "off" to begin with.  If they are, then no change will
occur to the selected entries when exiting the PHONE ENTRY EDITOR requester.
If one gadget of the Dial Prefix (or similar option group) is toggled on, all
entries selected will be updated to this selection.  If you decide to not use
the selected option, toggle it again and it will turn "off". This action will
only occur during the global edit mode of operation, otherwise it will operate
"normally" during a singular edit of a phonebook entry.

   The Reset Timer is an example of an "on/off" option, so, its setting will
be copied over to each selected entry regardless if you have never touched
it.

   The SERIAL and XFERS gadgets will open their respective requesters and
operate the same as the PHONE ENTRY EDITOR requester.  The TERMINAL
PARAMETERS requester is a different beast altogether however, so please
pay attention to the following.

   The CR xlate, LF xlate, EOL out and Capture filters work the same as
the mutually excluded groups described above.  The Miscellaneous group
of options are all "on/off" gadgets, so you must set the ones you want
on.  The Screen type, Emulation and Text size gadget groups should only be
tinkered with *after* you have selected an emulation.  Remember this!

   The four color options at the bottom are all initially set to the
value of 16, this is an invalid color number, so JR-Edit will not set
phonebook entries unless these numbers are something other than 16.

   If you find that you've set something that you didn't intend to set or
you wish to start over, just close the requester (SERIAL, TERMINAL or 
TRANSFER only) and then re-open it.  Everything will be reset.

   If you decide that you do not want to globally set any of the phonebook
entries, select the CANCEL gadget in the PHONE ENTRY EDITOR requester.

   Again, please save your phonebook prior to doing any global editing in
case you muck things up too badly.
