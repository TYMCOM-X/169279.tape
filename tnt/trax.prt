 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION : 
REC'D A CALL FROM RICK REQUESTING A TICKET BE OPENED FOR SLOT 2 ON NODE         
2065.  THE SLOT HALTS SVC WHEN THE NW BND FILE IS LOADED IN THE NODE.           
PER REQUEST FROM THOMAS AT 01:20 NSSC RELOADED NW2065.BND. THEN RELOADED

I loaded the BBXS code in my lab machine running 7.03 ISIS and 5.22 Node Code   
and everything was fine.  The dumps showed a "connect sync" failure for

ALL THIS IS A CMTI INTERFACE RUNNING VERSION 7.04 CODE AND THAT THE

 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION : 
NSSC RECEIVED CALL FROM THOMAS/HKOPPS.  HE REPORTS THAT LINE 1 OF               
2780 HASP INTERFACE IN SLOT 3 OF 2050 IS IN THE LWAIT STATE.  NSSC              
CHECKED DDT WHICH CONFIRMED THIS.  NSSC OBTAINED TRACE (NSSC:37)CM2050.TR1.     
NSSC THEN DUMPED SLOT TO SYSTEM 37, FILE NAME CM2050.D31 AND RELOADED USING     
(CIDNCODE:37)CM2050.N03.  SLOT IS UP AND RUNNING AFTER RELOAD.  NSSC CALLED     
AND NOTIFIED THOMAS THAT RELOAD WAS COMPLETED.  NSSC WILL TURN DUMP AND         
TRACE OVER TO CS/LEN WOLF ON MONDAY A.M. FOR FURTHER EVALUATION.

THE DUMP SHOWS THAT DSR IS NOT PRESENT ON PORTS 0,1,& 2                         
THESE ARE THE PORTS IN THE LWT STATE, WHICH IS A NORMAL STATE FOR A             
SWITCH ENVIORNMENT WHICH IS WHAT THE 1ST 3 PORTS ARE.  IF CUSTOMER WOULD        
BRING UP DSR THIS INTERFACE WOULD WORK FINE.  I SEE NO PROBLEM HERE

PLEASE ADVISE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS HERE SINCE ALL LOOKS NORMAL.  NO DSR          
NO ACTIVE CIRCUIT.  LWAIT IS THE NORMAL IDLE STATE FOR A SWITCHED ENVIORNMENT   
WHICH IS WHAT THE 1ST 3 PORTS ARE.  THE LAST 2 PORTS ARE IN AN UNSWITCHED       
ENVIORNMENT AND NOT TO BE CONFUSED.  PLEASE ADVISE IF THERE IS SOMETHING I

 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION :

NODE USUALLY CRASHES AROUND THIS TIME AND COMES BACH WITH "END OF TAKE" MSSG.   
NSSC WILL NOTIFY HK ABOUT THIS LINE PROBLEM SO THEY CAN HAVE JAKARTA SITE

PER ONTYME #MF90764 ANTHONY HAD NODE BOOTED AND IT TOOK LOAD ON SYS 37 OF       
(CIDNCODE)CM2151.BND. NOTE THAT NODE NEVER ACTUALLY CRASHED BUT WAS DEAD        
ENDED OFF OF NEIGHBOR N2050. NSSC WILL TRY TO HAVE NODE BOOTED AND OBTAIN       
DUMP IF THIS REOCCURS. IT APPEARS TO JUST BE A LINE PROBLEM.
