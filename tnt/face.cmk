Very confused on this.  Customer says he has TXD and RXD on his mode.           
Both DBU MB1 & 2 number are busy, yet host 8663 is shut.  What is talking       
to the host down there?  Could be switched MREF on our equipment?               
Per tym file  M.REF(0,4)=H:12487 M.REF(0,5)=H:12609 and M.REF(0,1)=H:8663.

Host has never been up.  Over to CHAD for check of node site modem.             
FE should check MB1 Dial Backup number to see if it is dialing out.             
Also check lease line for any tone coming into it?  (3000 HZ tone).             
Might have to turn over to Telco if all works out!
