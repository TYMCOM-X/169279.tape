HARDWARE:  DIAL ACCESS 296
SUBJECT:  DIAL ACCESS 296 STRAPPING FOR ASYNC, SYNC, X.25 AND DIAL BACKUP


There are presently three types of Concord 296 modems being used in the
Tymnet network.

 1) Concord Data Systems 296 TRELLIS (White Box) used as an answer
    modem on a two-wire 1MB/RJ45 line at a Tymnet site for Async
    9600 baud dial-up , offering level 4 MNP error correction.

 2) Concord Data Systems V32 TRELLIS (Whit Box) used as an answer
    modem on a two-wire 1MB/RJ45 line at a Tymnet site for X25 dial-up
    9600 baud Sync.
    or
    Point to point four wire 3002 leased line at 9600 baud with (one) two
    wire 1MB/RJ45 Dial back-up line (PSTN).

 3) Concord Data Systems  DIAL ACCESS 296 (grey box). This box can be
    configured for Async and Sync. It can be used for Async dial-up
    (Tymnet site), Leased Line Point to point (four wire or two wire)
    with dial back-up and X25 dial-up (Tymnet site). This modem also
    uses MNP level 4 .

     STRAPPING FOR 9600 BAUD ASYNC DIAL-UP ANSWER MODE (TYMNET SITE)
     ---------------------------------------------------------------

1) Set the switches on the back of the modem to the following settings.

	SWA-2	ON
	SWB-1	ON


2) After setting the dip switches connect a 9600 baud terminal to the DTE
   port to program the soft-straps. With the modem powered up press the
   return key twice. At the  "MODEM >" prompt type RESET. The modem will ask
   "ARE YOU SURE ? [Y OR N]. Type a Y. This will reset the modem to the
   factory default settings.


Enter the following commands at the prompt terminating each command with
a carriage return.

   SLCD4
   SPF1
   SBK5
   SMF0
   SLT0
   STI0
   SRP MDCTYMNET
   SAVE
   INIT

   Enter the command RSF at the MODEM > prompt. RSF is short for Review
   Setting - Full list. The following display should appear on your screen:

        SLCH:0


At the MODEM > prompt enter SRM2. After you enter the carraige return you
will not see any response. Type "SAVE" return, and "INIT" and return.
This will disable sending the Concord banner to the consat.
Type RSF and return and check to make sure the softstraps are set
correctely. SRM0 will give you the echo back.

   You are now finished strapping the modem. Connect the engine's SIO ASYNC
port to the DTE port on the modem. Be sure the baud rate of the SIO port is
set for 9600. Connect the dial-up phone line to the DIAL jack on the back of
the modem and power on the modem if it is not already. Check for DTR on
the front of the modem.

*****************************************************************************

    9600 and 4800 baud Sync mode using a 4-wire or 2-wire Leased Line
    =================================================================

			With Manual Dial Back-up
			========================

1) Turn the modem OFF . Set the Rear panel switches to the following
   settings:
	SWA-2  ON	(9600 baud)
	-or-
	SWA-2 and 3 ON	(4800 baud)

	SWB-3  ON       (2-wire leased line)
	SWB-3  OFF      (four-wire leased line)

	SWB-1  ON
	SWB-4  ON  (OFF if customer is using RJ45 type Jack)

2) Turn the modem ON. Hook a terminal to the RS-232 . Wake up the modem
   with two carriage returns. At the Modem prompt type  RESET. When the modem
   responds with "are you sure?" type "Y" and return. Now you are ready to
   enter the softstraps.

   At the MODEM prompt Type:

	 SPB4800  (This sets the port speed to 4800 when SWA 2 and 3 is
		   set for 4800. Once you set this strap you must set your
		   Terminal speed to 4800 baud)


	 (SDL1 for Originate)
	 (SDL2 for Answer)
	 SLCD0
	 STI000
	 SLT0
	 SMF0
	 SXLP000
	 SAVE
	 INIT
   If dial back-up is being used enter the phone number into modem memory
   01.	
	 WP1/Wnnnnnnnn
	  RP  (read phone list to verify)


   SLCD0 will ignore DTR and keep the modem from dropping the line.
   STI000 will disable the modem's inactivity timer. If you do not do this
   the modem will drop the line every thirty minutes and retrain.

3) Remove your cable from the termianl to the modem and hook the Sync
   cabel to the modem.  Turn the modem OFF set switch SWA-8 ON, Turn
   the modem back ON, the modem should come up in the SYNC mode.

4) Check to see the LEASE switch LED indicator is ON.

5) Tymnet will be Answer and the Customer will be Originate.
	
6) To initiate a retrain press the # switch.



	Making a Dial Back-up call from the Customer modem
	==================================================

1) Press the LEASE button (LEASE LED OFF)

2) Wait 2 minutes and press the # button once. This will dial the number
   stored in memory number 1 of the modem.
   There is a 1 minute timer on the ANSWER side. The ANSWER modem will
   not answer the dial back-up call until this timer has expired.

3) To terminate a dial back-up call press the LEASE button (LEASE LED
   ON) . This will take less than 30 seconds to drop dial and go back
   to LEASE.

		9600 baud SYNC X.25 dial-up Tymnet Site
		=======================================

	             Answer mode Tymnet Site
		     =======================

1) Turn the modem OFF. Set the rear panel switches to the following
   settings:

	SWA-2	ON	(9600 baud)
	SWA-8	ON	(Sync mode)

	SWB-1	ON
	SWB-4	ON

2) Turn the modem ON. Press the SYNC button so the LED is OFF. This
   puts the modem in the Async mode. Hook  a terminal to the RS-232
   port. Wake up the modem with two carriage returns . At the Modem
   prompt type RESET. When the modem responds with "are you sure?"
   type "Yes" and return. Now you are ready to enter the softstraps.

   At the Modem prompt enter the following soft straps:
	STI000
	SLT0
	SXLP000
	SMF0
	SAVE
	INIT
	(SLCD0 should be set only for a PAP by request of the customer
         only if the customer chooses to ignore the 3 minute timer
	 to drop DTR and Disconnect the call)

3) Check the Modem's LEDs. The SYNC LED should be ON.
   For the Answer mode the ORIG LED should be OFF.

**NOTE**
YOU WILL NOT SEE CLOCKS UNTIL A CONNECTION IS MADE (DIAL OR LEASE).

For loop back testing you will need to the use the LOOP2 or LOOP3 button
on the front of the modem. If you loop back the channel interface card
the modem will never come up . For remote loop back testing use the
LOOP2 button this will place the remote modem in loopback sending the right
answer or originate frequency back to the modem requesting the loop
back. Using a red box place it on the RS-232 port of the modem, press
LOOP2 and run a BERT test. Inject 5 errors . You should see your 5
errors. Test for 15 minutes.
