OVERVIEW                                                       February 28, 1986






                                 1 -  OVERVIEW


            This diagnostic comprehensively examines the synchronous inter-
            face board(s) of an Engine  or Mini-Engine using the unenhanced
            Input/Output (I/O) and enhanced interrupt-handling capabilities
            of each machine.  It checks the equivalent synchronous logic on
            the I/O board  of the Micro-Engine  and verifies  enhanced syn-
            chronous  interrupt handling  in  the  Central Processing  Unit
            (CPU) of  all three machines.  However,  it does not  check the
            special enhanced synchronous CPU instructions.

            The Enhanced  Synchronous Diagnostic  can serve  to verify  the
            working  condition of  the hardware  under  test or  to aid  in
            troubleshooting hardware problems.

            The operating procedure  requires both a display  console and a
            terminal for input of commands and  control functions, and out-
            put of messages.  The commands  allow the operator considerable
            flexibility in controlling the diagnostic, including the selec-
            tion  of tests  and  test iterations,  selection  of data,  and
            selection of synchronous lines to be tested.  Terminal messages
            provide error codes, data, and information relating to the sta-
            tus of  the diagnostic.   In some  cases, the  messages provide
            extensive additional information when errors are encountered.

            The  diagnostic performs  ten  individual  tests, as  shown  in
            Table 1-1.  Within specified limits, each  test can be selected
            and  run individually.   Tests  1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 comprise  the
            default test group,  which, when run  together, perform  a com-
            plete verification of  the  enhanced  capabilities of the hard-
            ware.  To  verify  unenhanced synchronous features, Tests 3 and
            4 must be run following the  execution of Tests 1 and 2.  Tests
            8, 9, and 10 are intended for use as scope loops.

            Throughout this chapter, the terms "line pair" and "synchronous
            line" are  used synonymously  to refer  to the  clocked receive
            data  and transmit  data lines  associated  with an  individual
            port.   The term  "line" refers  to a  specific transmit  line,
            receive  line, or  control  line, each  having  its own  device
            address.  For  testing purposes, the two  lines of a  line pair
            are  connected together  through a  loopback plug.   Individual
            lines can  be added  to or deleted  from testing  by specifying
            their respective device  addresses as parameters in  the appro-
            priate command.

                  4.1  Loopback Plugs - Engine and Mini-Engine


            Two types of loopback plugs are available:

              o  P/N 630009-001 (AST 5-1)

              o  P/N 160100-001 (AST 7-1)

            The first type, test plug set  P/N 630009-001, AST 5-1, is con-
            nected directly to  the Synchronous I/O board.   This test plug
            set consists of four synchronous  test plugs for connectors X4,
            X6, X7, and X9 and four clock  plugs for connectors X3, X5, X8,
            and X10, all of which are located on the front edge of the Syn-
            chronous I/O board  (see Figures 4-1 and 4-4).   When this type
            of loopback plug is  used, the diagnostic checks  only the Syn-
            chronous I/O board(s).

            The second type, test plug set P/N 160100-001, AST 7-1, is con-
            nected at  the connector panel of  the machine under  test (see
            Figures 4-2 and  4-5).  This set consists of  four 37-pin plugs

            for the  synchronous connectors, together  with the  four clock
            plugs (from AST 5-1) for connectors X3,  X5, X8, and X10 on the
            Engine Synchronous  I/O board.   This second  type of  loopback
            plug  permits  the  diagnostic to  check  the  Synchronous  I/O
            board(s), the connector panel, and the board-to-panel cabling.

            The Micro-Engine requires the  following special loopback plugs
            (see Figures 4-3 and 4-6):

              o  P/N 630030-001 (1 plug each for ports 2, 3, 6, and 7)

              o  P/N 630025-001 (1 plug, ports 10, 11, 14, and 15)

                         5 -  CONFIGURATION CONSTRAINTS


            Both a terminal and a display  console must be connected to the
            machine under  test.  Proper connections  for a terminal  and a
            console are described in Diagnostics Introduction.

            Except for the synchronous I/O circuitry  under test, the hard-
            ware must  be in known  working order.   If there is  any doubt
            regarding the condition of the hardware, run the Memory and CPU
            diagnostics first.

            A complete set  of test (loopback) plugs must  be connected for
            each Synchronous I/O board in  an Engine or Mini-Engine system,
            or for all  available synchronous lines on  a Micro-Engine.  If
            these plugs are not connected, errors will occur in all tests.

            A clock must be provided for  each synchronous line under test.

            For an Engine or Mini-Engine, this  is accomplished by means of
            the four clock  plugs in the loopback plug  set P/N 630009-001.

            For a Micro-Engine, appropriate jumpers must  be set at J-14 of
            the I/O board (see Figure 6-1).

            All synchronous  lines on a Micro-Engine  may be set  for 19.2K
            baud clocks, or slower, without  causing false errors to occur.

            However, on an  Engine or a Mini-Engine, the  higher baud rates
            restrict the number of synchronous lines  that can be tested at
            one time without overloading the CPU.  Table 5-1 shows the max-
            imum number  of lines which the  diagnostic is able to  test at
            each baud rate.

                 gine at 19.2K baud, all  synchronous lines except the
                 line(s)  under  test  must be  deleted  from  testing

                                        ____

            When testing an Engine or  Mini-Engine at 9600 baud with two
            Synchronous I/O boards  present in the system, do one of the
            following:
                                             ___
              1. Connect loopback plugs to both Synchronous I/O boards
                 and set all clocks  to  9600 baud.  Run  Test 1,  and
                 then  use  the   Delete  command (DEL [xx,yy],...) to
                 delete from testing all lines  on the second Synchro-
                 nous  I/O   board.   Remove  all clock plugs from the
                 second   board.   Then  run  Test  2  and  any  other
                 desired tests.  After verifying  the operation of the
                 first Synchronous  I/O board, reverse  the procedure,
                 using the  Delete command  and the  Add command  (ADD
                 [xx,yy],...) to  specify the synchronous lines  to be
                 tested on the second board.  Remove all  clock  plugs
                 in the first  board and  plug  them  into  the second
                 board.

              2. If two sets of loopback plugs are not available, con-
                 nect one  set of plugs  to the first  Synchronous I/O
                 board, remove the  second board from the  system, and
                 run  the  desired  tests.  Then  install  the  second
                 board, connect  the loopback  plugs, and  restart the
                 diagnostic.   After running  Test 1,  use the  Delete
                 command (DEL [xx,yy],...) to delete  all lines on the
                 first board.  Then  run Test 2 and  the other desired
                 tests.

                           7 -  OPERATING PROCEDURES


            This  section  covers  only  the  basic  operating  procedures.
            Because of the extensive flexibility  available to the operator
            in running this diagnostic, this section should be read in con-
            junction with  Sections 8 and 9  before attempting to  load and
            run the program.

            The use  of both an  Engine display  console and a  terminal is
            required.   The terminal  must  be  connected to  the  terminal
            interface  port on  the  Multifunction board  of  an Engine  or
            Mini-Engine, or to the Multifunction  port (labeled MULTIFN) on
            the rear panel of a Micro-Engine.


                                         NOTE
                                         ____
                 The setting of the baud-rate  selector switch for the
                 terminal interface (SWT-9 on the Engine Multifunction
                 board or S-2 on the Micro-Engine I/O board) must cor-
                 respond to the terminal baud rate.







                           7.1  Preliminary Procedure


            The following preliminary steps must  be taken prior to running
            the diagnostic.

              1. Connect a  terminal to the  machine under  test.  Set
                 the baud-rate selector switch for the terminal inter-
                 face to match the terminal baud rate.

              2. If  the machine  under  test is  a  Mini-Engine or  a
                 Micro-Engine, connect  an Engine  display console  as
                 described in the Diagnostics Introduction.
                                  ________________________

              3. Load the  diagnostic by one  of the  standard methods
                 described in the Diagnostics Introduction.
                                  ________________________

              4. Connect the appropriate set of  loopback plugs to the

17                 Enhanced Synchronous Diagnostic User Guide             DSYN03
OPERATING PROCEDURES                                           February 28, 1986


                 machine under test, after  first checking that cables
                                     _____
                 are labeled to facilitate easy reconnection.

              5. If the machine  under test is a  Micro-Engine, ensure
                 that the  necessary clock  for each  synchronous line
                 under test is  provided by means of a  jumper at J-14
                 on the I/O board (see Figure 6-1).









                              7.2  Start Procedure


            Unless a  downline load was  performed using LOADII,  start the
            diagnostic by pressing the  following keys on the  display con-
            sole:

                 DTA, A, 0, 0, ADR, RUN

            The program will  initialize itself and determine  what type of
            Engine system  it is  running in.   (The program  distinguishes
            between only  two system  types: REGULAR  ENGINE and  MICRO.  A
            "regular engine"  will be  reported for either  an Engine  or a
            Mini-Engine; a "micro engine" will be  reported for a Micro-En-
            gine.  If the  program finds a "regular engine,"  it checks for
            the number  of Synchronous  I/O boards  present.)  The  program
            then  displays a  message on  the terminal,  consisting of  the
            diagnostic title,  engine type  determined, and  the diagnostic
            prompt (*).  The prompt indicates that  the program is ready to
            accept commands.

            Example:

                 ENHANCED SYNC DIAGNOSTIC   VERSION 3.0
                 SYSTEM TYPE FOUND = REGULAR ENGINE
                 *

            If LOADII was  used to load the  program, and if a  terminal is
            attached to the  terminal interface,  the diagnostic  will ini-
            tialize itself automatically after loading.  It will then check
            for the system type and display the title message and a prompt.

            If a terminal is not attached,  however, and LOADII was used to
            load the program,  the diagnostic will hang,  waiting for input
            from a terminal.   Once a terminal is  attached, the diagnostic
            can be  started by  entering the normal  start sequence  on the

            console:

                 DTA, A, 0, 0, ADR, RUN



                                         NOTE
                                         ____
                 The program checks three  hardware items to determine
                 what system  type ("regular" Engine  or Micro-Engine)
                 it is running in:  the  primary ac voltage level, the
                 type of  Memory Access Controller (MAC)  present, and
                 the number  of synchronous  l ines  present.  When  a
                 hardware malfunction produces  incompatible responses
                 for one  or more of  these items, the  message SYSTEM
                 TYPE  FOUND = UNKNOWN!!!  will  be  displayed on  the
                 terminal.  As  far as  this diagnostic  is concerned,
                 this message can be ignored when it occurs in testing
                 an Engine or Mini-Engine.  If  it occurs in testing a
                 Micro-Engine, however,  the ADD command must  be used
                 to specify every line pair that is to be tested.  The
                 ADD command  must be  entered after  Test 1  has been
                                               _____
                 run, but before  Test 2 and any other  tests are run;
                          ______
                 otherwise, no lines will be tested.








                             7.3  Testing Procedure


            When the diagnostic prompt is  displayed, the command processor
            is ready  to accept  commands and  cause the  program to  begin
            testing.  Upon completing a function, test, or series of tests,
            the program  returns to the  command processor and  prompts for
            further commands.

            The testing procedure  can be varied by  the operator according
            to the requirements of a given testing situation.  For example,
            if only  routine verification  of the  hardware is  needed, the
            default   test  group  (Tests 1, 2, 5, 6, 7) can be executed by
            entering  the  RUN command on  the terminal.  The default  test
            group performs a complete verification of  the hardware without
            operator  intervention,  and the enhanced synchronous microcode
            is enabled in the  Program  Status  Word (PSW).  To perform the
            same  verification  with  unenhanced  synchronous   interrupts,
            Tests 1, 2, 3,  and 4  can  be selected  using the RUN command.

19                 Enhanced Synchronous Diagnostic User Guide             DSYN03
OPERATING PROCEDURES                                           February 28, 1986


            There  is  a   useful  command  "RUN MOST"  for   running  both
            enhanced   and  unenhanced  Tests  (1-7)  to perform a complete
            verification.

            To troubleshoot a suspected problem associated with an individ-
            ual port, the  Delete Lines command (DEL)  can be used  in con-
            junction with the  Add Lines command (ADD) to  isolate and test
            only the synchronous line pair for  that port.  If a problem is
            intermittent, a large number  of test iterations can  be speci-
            fied by using the Set Loop Count command (LOP).



                                         NOTE
                                         ____
                 When either  the Halt on  Error command (HLT)  or the
                 Set Loop Count command (LOP)  is enabled, the program
                 may not  return to  the command  processor.  In  this
                 case,  the   diagnostic  must  be  halted   and  then
                 restarted from the console at address A00.



            If an error is detected during testing, the program displays an
            error message on the terminal.  Five different terminal message
            commands are  available which either  increase or  decrease the
            amount of  information that will  be displayed on  the terminal
            (see Table 7-1).

            If a Synchronous I/O  board is installed or  removed, the diag-
            nostic should be  restarted from the console  at memory address
            A00; otherwise, false errors may be reported.






            7.3.1  Default Tests

            The default test group (Tests 1, 2, 5, 6, 7) can be executed by
            entering this command on the terminal (in either upper or lower
            case):

                 RUN<CR>

            The program will  then  execute  Tests 1,  2,  5,  6,  and 7 in
            numerical order.

            With the Message  Command (MSG) enabled (the  default condition
            of the program) the following  information will be displayed on
            the terminal as each test is executed:

            The approximate time required to run  the  default  test  group
            with 300 baud terminal is as follows:

            Engine or Mini-Engine
            _____________________

                 32 lines, 4800 baud - 14.5 minutes

                 32 lines, 9600 baud - 11.0 minutes

                 24 lines, 19.2K baud - 7.0  minutes


            Micro-Engine
            ____________

                 16 lines, 4800 baud - 10.8 minutes

                 16 lines, 9600 baud -  7.7 minutes

                 16 lines, 19.2K baud - 5.8 minutes

                  8 lines, 4800 baud -  9.5 minutes

                  8 lines, 9600 baud -  6.0 minutes

                  8 lines, 19.2K baud - 4.5 minutes


            Note that each sync mother board has 32 lines.






            7.3.2  Non-default Tests

            If tests other than, or in  addition to, the default test group
            are to be run, the appropriate  test numbers must be entered as
            parameters in the RUN command string.

            Example:

                 RUN 1,2,3,4<CR>

            Whenever test numbers  are included in the  RUN command string,
            only the  specified tests  will be  run.  Test  numbers may  be
            entered in any  order, but tests will be  executed in numerical
            order.

            In order to execute Tests 3 through 7, the program uses some of
            the results of Tests  1 and 2.  For this reason,  Tests 1 and 2

23                 Enhanced Synchronous Diagnostic User Guide             DSYN03
OPERATING PROCEDURES                                           February 28, 1986


            must always  be run  whenever one  of the  following conditions
            prevails:

              o  Any of  Tests 3  through 7  are to  be run  after the
                 diagnostic  has been  started or  restarted from  the
                 console.

              o  The No Options command (NOOPT) has been entered.

              o  One or  more loopback  plugs have  been installed  or
                 removed.

                                         NOTE
                                         ____
                 If Tests 1 and 2 are not  run in each of these cases,
                 the diagnostic may report false  errors and/or incor-
                 rect results.







            7.3.3  Testing Individual Ports

            Each synchronous port can be  isolated and tested individually,
            as, for example, when testing two  19.2K baud lines.  To verify
            the hardware  with respect to  only one  port, or a  few ports,
            perform the following procedure.

              1. With  loopback plugs  installed to  the tested  ports
                 (all loopback plugs of untested ports should be  dis-
                 connected),  start  or  restart  the   diagnostic  by
                 entering  the  start  command sequence on the  system
                 console:

                     DTA, A, 0, 0, ADR, RUN

              2. Delete all lines by entering:

                     DEL<CR>

              3. At the prompt (*) enter:

                     ADD xx,yy,bf

                 where xx and yy correspond to the device addresses of
                 the synchronous line pair(s) to  be tested, and bf is
                 the  synchronous  status/control  line  address  (see
                 Table 7-1).

              4. At the  prompt (*)  enter the  Print Options  command

                 (OPT) to  confirm that only  the specified  lines are
                 available for testing.

                           8 -  COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS


            Operator control  of this  diagnostic is  provided by  means of
            commands entered on the terminal.  These commands are described
            in subsequent sections according to the following categories:

              o  Operating Commands

              o  Option Commands

              o  Line Commands

              o  Terminal Message Commands

              o  Memory Location Commands

            A special portion of the program, called the command processor,
            interprets operator  input from the  terminal and  passes valid
            commands to  the program  for execution.   When the  diagnostic
            prompt (*) is displayed on  the terminal, the command processor
            is ready  to accept a command  (which may be entered  in either
            upper  or lowercase).   If the  command  processor receives  an
            unrecognizable command, it displays this  message on the termi-
            nal:  COMMAND NOT RECOGNIZED OR INVALID, followed by the prompt
            (*).  If  it receives an  otherwise valid command  containing a
            syntax error, it responds with a  question mark (?) and another
            prompt  (*).  See  the Diagnostics Introduction  for a  general
                                   ________________________
            discussion of command format and syntax.

            Note that  a Carriage Return <CR>  must be entered  to indicate
            the end of  a command word or command string.   A Question Mark
            (?)  entered before  the  <CR> cancels  that  command line  and
            causes a new prompt (*) to be displayed.

                                         NOTE

                            8.1  Operating Commands


            The operating commands initiate testing (RUN), cancel a command
            entry (?),  cause the program  to loop (LOP)  or to halt  on an
            error (HLT), or abort the execution of a test (Escape key).






            8.1.1  Run

            Syntax:  RUN [n],...

            Default: Tests 1, 2, 5, 6, 7

            This command  starts execution  of tests, where  n is   operand
            which  could  be  either the  test  number  (in decimal) of the
            individual test(s) to be run or the parameter "MOST".


            Test  numbers  may be  entered  in any   order,  but  tests are
            executed in numerical  order.  Test  numbers must  be separated
            by commas in the command string.  If n is MOST, all  Tests from
            1 through 7 are executed in numerical order.



                                         NOTE
                                         ____
                 After starting  the diagnostic,  Tests 1 and 2 should
                 be run  first.  Any  line that  does not  pass Test 1
                 will not be tested  by the other tests  unless speci-
                 fied by the ADD command.  If Test 1 is not run first,
                 Tests 3 - 7 will get false error messages.  Any lines
                 failing Test 2 will fail all  other tests, because no
                 alignment factor will have  been computed.  If Test 2
                 is not run,  false errors will occur  in Tests 3 - 7.
                 Tests 8, 9, and 10 are not affected by Tests 1 and 2.

            8.1.2  Cancel Command Entry

            Syntax:  ?

            Default: None

            A ?  entered in  the command string  cancels the  command being
            entered and  causes the command processor  to prompt for  a new
            command.  The  ? may  be entered  at any  point in  the command
            string before the <CR>.  Once a <CR> has been entered, however,
            a command cannot  be cancelled.  (No data in  memory is changed
            if the ? is used to cancel a Modify Memory (MOD) command.)








            8.1.3  Abort Testing

            Syntax:  Escape key  (usually labeled ESC on the terminal)

            Default: None

            Pressing the  terminal Escape  key (ESC) while  any of  Tests 1
            through 7 or  Test 10 are running, aborts the  test in progress
            and restarts the  program.  Tests 1 and 2 should  then be rerun
            before running tests  3 through 7; otherwise,  false errors may
            occur.

            Pressing the  Escape key during execution  of Tests 8 or  9 has
            one of the following effects.

              o  halts testing and returns a  prompt if the loop count
                 is 1,  and no other tests  were specified in  the RUN
                 command

              o  halts and then  repeats the current test  if the loop
                 count is other than 1, and no other tests were speci-
                 fied in the RUN command

              o  halts the current test and  begins the next test that
                 was specified in  the RUN command, regardless  of the
                 loop count value

            Note  that   the  program  is   not  restarted   when  aborting
            Test 8 or 9 (situation 1  above).  It is not  necessary, there-
            fore, to rerun Tests 1 and 2 after aborting Test 8 or 9.

            8.1.4  Set Loop Count


            Syntax:  LOP [n]

            Default: 1

            This command specifies  the number of times (n) that  a test or
            series of  tests will  be repeated,  where n  is the  number of
                                                       _
            iterations (in  hexadecimal) ranging from  0 to  7FFFFFFF.  The
            program executes  each test (or  series of tests)  specified by
            the RUN  command before  going to  the next  pass of  the loop.

            When a loop value of 0 is  specified, Tests 1 - 7 will run con-
            tinuously until halted by pressing the terminal Escape key.  If
            a loop value greater than 1 is specified, Tests 1 - 7 will loop
            n times unless  halted by the Escape key.  For  Tests 8, 9, and
            _
            10, a loop  value of 1 should be specified  because these three
            Tests  automatically  repeat  themselves until  halted  by  the
            Escape key.

            The LOP command is overridden by  the HLT command when an error
            is  detected and,  therefore,  may  be particularly  useful  in
            detecting intermittent  hardware failures.   When both  the LOP
            and HLT commands are enabled, the program will halt if an error
            occurs or loop  the specified number of times if  an error does
            not occur.

                                         NOTE
                                         ____
                 If a loop value other than 1  is in effect while run-
                 ning Tests 8, 9, or 10, the program will merely go to
                 the next  iteration when the  Escape key  is pressed.

                 To abort Test  8, 9, or 10 in such a  case, press the
                 PSW key on  the console and then  restart the program
                 at  address  A00.   Entering LOP<CR>  at  the  prompt
                 restores the loop value to 1; otherwise, the previous
                 loop count remains in effect.

            8.1.5  Halt on Error

            Syntax:  HLT

            Default: Disabled

            This command causes the program to halt  on an error after dis-
            playing an  error message on  the terminal.  The  error message
            will consist of the error  code only; no additional information
            will be  displayed.  Press  RUN on the  console to  restart the
            program.

            Note that the HLT command will  override the LOP command.  When
            both commands are enabled, the  program will loop the specified
            number of times unless halted by an error.






            8.1.6  No Halt on Error

            Syntax:  NOHLT

            Default: Enabled

            This command  causes the  diagnostic not to  halt on  an error.
            The HLT and NOHLT commands are mutually exclusive.







                              8.2  Option Commands


            The option commands are used to list valid commands, tests, and
            lines available for testing, and to reset command parameters.

            8.2.1  Help

            Syntax:  HELP

            Default: None

            This command displays a list of all valid commands and tests.











            8.2.2  Print Options

            Syntax:  OPT

            Default: None

            This command displays the current state of all commands and the
            device addresses of all lines available for testing.






            8.2.3  No Options

            Syntax:  NOOPT

            Default: None

            This command resets all commands to their default values.

                                        CAUTION
                                        _______
                 This command also  deletes all lines from  testing if
                 it is  entered immediately  after the  diagnostic has
                 been started  or restarted.  In  such a  case, always
                 run  Tests 1  and 2  before  proceeding with  further
                 testing.

            device address.






            8.3.1  Add a Line

            Syntax:  ADD [xx],...

            Default: No parameter = all lines

            This command  adds lines to be  tested, where xx is  the device
            address (in hexadecimal) of the added line(s).  As many parame-
            ters (addresses) as will fit on one  command line may be speci-
            fied with each entry of this command.  The parameters are sepa-
            rated by  commas.  If  no parameter is  entered, all  lines are
            added, that is, lines 20 - 5F, BF, and FF (see Table 7-1).



                                         NOTE
                                         ____
                 Use of this  command modifies the table  of available
                 lines that is created in memory by Test 1.  The table
                 determines which lines  will be tested.  If  both the
                 receive line and the transmit line of a line pair are
                 not listed  in this table,  errors will occur  in all
                 subsequent tests.   The safest  procedure to  follow,
                 therefore, when using the ADD  command, is to specify
                 both lines of a line pair  in the ADD command string.

                 To confirm which lines are available for testing, use
                 the OPT command.

                 Note also that if the added lines have not previously
                 been tested by Test 2, then Test 2 must be run before
                 proceeding  with  Tests 3 - 7;  otherwise,  incorrect
                 results will be reported.   Note that this precaution
                 does not contradict  the procedure described  in Sec-
                 tion 7.3.3, Testing Individual Ports.

            Syntax:  DEL [xx],...

            Default: No parameter = all lines

            This command deletes lines from testing, where xx is the device
            address (in hexadecimal)  of each line to be  deleted.  As many
            parameters (device addresses)  as will fit on  one command line
            may be specified.  The parameters  must be separated by commas.
            If no parameter is entered, this command deletes all lines (see

                         8.4  Terminal Message Commands


            The  terminal message  commands (Message,  MSG; Error  Message,
            ERRMSG; No Message,  NOMSG; Dump, DMP; No  Dump, NODMP) control
            the amount of information displayed on the terminal.  They have
            no effect on  the system console.  Table 8-1 shows  the type of
            information corresponding to each command.

            The  MSG command  is in  effect  when the  diagnostic is  first
            started after loading, and is re-enabled when the NOOPT command
            is entered.   Entering the  DMP command,  when MSG  is enabled,
            provides the maximum  amount of information.  The  MSG, ERRMSG,
            and NOMSG commands  are mutually exclusive.  The  DMP and NODMP
            commands are also mutually exclusive.

            8.5.1  Bias

            Syntax:  BI [xxxxxx]

            Default: 0

            This command sets the bias for the Examine Memory (EXA) and MOD
            commands.  It has one parameter, a  hexadecimal number of up to
            six digits.  This  number is added to the address  given in the
            MOD or EXA commands before a  memory location is accessed.  (If
            more than six digits are entered, only the last six entered are
            used.)  If no parameter is given, the program displays the cur-
            rent bias on the terminal.






            8.5.2  Examine Memory

            Syntax:  EXA xxxxxx,[yyyy]

            Default: yyyy = 0001

            This command displays  the contents  of specified  memory loca-
            tions on the terminal  as hexadecimal, decimal, and  ASCII val-
            ues.  The EXA  command has two parameters.   The first, xxxxxx,
            is a six digit hexadecimal number that, when added to the bias,
            becomes the address from  which the program will  start to dis-
            play the contents of memory.  The  second parameter, yyyy, is a
            four digit hexadecimal number that  specifies how many halfword
            locations will be read and displayed on the terminal.  The max-
            imum value  of this  second parameter  is FFFF.   If no  second
            parameter is entered, the  contents of only one  halfword loca-
            tion will be displayed.

            8.5.3  Modify Memory

            Syntax:  MOD [x],yyyyyy,zzzz,[zzzz],...

            Default:      x = hexadecimal
                     yyyyyy = none
                       zzzz = none

            This command writes data to the memory location specified.  The
            x   parameter    determines   the    format   of    the   data:
            H = hexadecimal, A = ASCII, D = decimal.   The yyyyyy parameter
            is a hexadecimal  number of up to  six digits that is  added to
            the bias to determine the  starting address of memory locations
            to be modified.   The zzzz  parameter(s) are  decimal or  hexa-
            decimal numbers or ASCII characters that  specify data by half-
            words.  The  halfwords of  data are  separated by  commas.  The
            data is  written to memory,  starting at location  yyyyyy.  The
            location is  incremented by  two as  each halfword  of data  is
            written to memory.

            If the number zzzz is too large, or is more than two characters
            (ASCII format  only), the memory  location is not  changed, and
            the command is aborted.  Previous parameters are stored in mem-
            ory.  The EXA command can be used to verify the contents of any
            memory location.

            Two ASCII characters are stored  in a halfword memory location.
            If a  zzzz parameter  is less  than two  ASCII characters,  the
            remainder of the  halfword memory location will  be filled with
            zeros.  Commas (,)  and Carriage Returns <CR>  cannot be stored
            in a  location (ASCII).  If no  format parameter (x)  is given,
            the format will be  the last used, and a comma  must be entered
            before  the yyyyyy  parameter.  When  the  diagnostic is  first
            started, the data format is hexadecimal.

                             9 -  TEST DESCRIPTIONS


            The ten individual  tests performed by this  diagnostic and the
            specific operations which they verify are described in the fol-
            lowing sections.

            Tests 1,2,5,6, and 7 make up the default test group.   In Tests
            5, 6, and 7, the  enhanced  synchronous  microcode  is  enabled
            (that is,  bit  6  of  the  PSW  is   set).  They  are executed
            automatically when the  RUN command is entered  on the terminal
            following the diagnostic prompt.  If no commands other than the
            RUN command have been entered, Tests 1,2,5,6 and 7 will perform
            a complete  verification  of  the  hardware  under test without
            operator intervention.

            Tests 3 and 4  check  the  hardware  with  enhanced synchronous
            interrupts  disabled in the PSW.   When  Tests 3 and 4 are run,
            the program returns to the command processor upon completion of
            the last test specified by the RUN command.  Tests 8, 9, and 10
            are scope loop tests and will  run indefinitely until halted by
            pressing the terminal Escape key.


            Tests  1 through  7  are executed  by command  "RUN  MOST" that
            verifies both enhanced and unenhanced synchronous interrupt.


                                         NOTE
                                         ____
                 If either the Loop command (LOP) or the Halt on Error
                 command (HLT) has  been enabled, the program  may not
                 return to the command  processor.  When this happens,
                 halt the  diagnostic by pressing  the PSW key  on the
                 console and restart the program at address A00.

            The time required for the program to execute each test is indi-
            cated at  the end of  the individual test  description.  Except
            for Tests  5, 8, 9,  and 10, these  times will double  when two
            Synchronous  I/O  boards  are being  tested.   When  testing  a
            Micro-Engine with eight synchronous lines,  the test times will
            be one-half what  is stated; if the Micro-Engine  has only four
            synchronous lines, then  the times will be  one-quarter what is
            stated.

            This is the  miscellaneous test and should always  be the first
            test run after  starting or restarting the  diagnostic.  Test 1
            performs the following:

              o  verifies  that Synchronous  I/O board(s)  are at  the
                 expected addresses

              o  displays on the terminal which boards are present (if
                 the MSG command is enabled)

              o  verifies synchronous return for these instructions:

                 RDR (Read Data Register)
                 WDR (Write Data Register)
                 SSR (Sense Status Register)

              o  verifies that each synchronous line will interrupt

              o  verifies that bit 6 of the PSW can be set and reset

              o  performs an incrementing data test on the synchronous
                 status/control line(s) at addresses BF and/or FF.

              o  sets up a table in  memory indicating for Tests 2 - 7
                 which lines are available for testing.  The table can
                 be modified by the ADD and DEL commands.

                 On a  Micro-Engine with four synchronous  lines, this
                 test will  display a message  stating that  lines 34,
                 35, 36, 37,  3C, 3E, and 3F did  not interrupt.  This
                 is normal and does not indicate an error.

                                  9.2  Test 2


            This is the line presence test  and should always be the second
            test run.   It verifies  that each  line transmits  or receives
            data with interrupts enabled, using the data pattern 0001.

            This test computes the  alignment factor for each  receive syn-
            chronous line under  test.  The alignment factor  is the number
            of bits that the  received data must be shifted to  the left to
            align it  with the  data output  by the  corresponding transmit
            line.  The alignment factor is used by Tests 3 - 7.

            This  is the  unenhanced  incrementing/decrementing data  test.
            With I/O  interrupts enabled, it  checks all  synchronous lines
            under test with  both incrementing  and decrementing  data pat-
            terns (in two passes) as follows:

                 0000 to FFFF incrementing by 1 - even line pairs

                                  9.7  Test 7


            This  is  the  enhanced  synchronous  incrementing/decrementing
            test.  This test is similar to Test 4 except that enhanced syn-
            chronous microcode is enabled in  the PSW.  With I/O interrupts
            and enhanced synchronous interrupts enabled, it checks all syn-
            chronous lines  under test with the  same data pattern  (in two
            passes) used in Test 4:

                 0000 to FFFF, incrementing by 1 - even line pairs
                 FFFF to 0000, decrementing by 1 - odd line pairs
                 FFFF to 0000, decrementing by 1 - even line pairs
                 0000 to FFFF, incrementing by 1 - odd line pairs

            While the test is running,  every 128th halfword of transmitted
            data used on the even line pairs is displayed on the right side
            of the console.

            Time required: 16 line pairs, 4800 baud - 14.2 minutes
            Time required: 16 line pairs, 9600 baud - 10.5 minutes







                                  9.8  Test 8


            This is  the unenhanced selectable  data test.  It  is intended
            for use as  a scope loop, and  the data are not  checked.  With
            I/O interrupts enabled, this test does the following:

              o  requests the  operator to enter  on the  terminal one
                 device address (either transmit  or receive) for each
                 synchronous line pair to be tested

              o  requests the operator to enter on the terminal one of
                 three optional data patterns to be used

              o  runs the specified data through the specified lines

            The test is halted  by pressing the Escape key if  a loop value
            of 1 is in effect (see Section 8.1.3, Abort Testing).

            To specify which lines are to be tested, enter on the terminal:

                 xx,yy,...,zz

            where  xx, yy,  and zz  are  the two  digit hexadecimal  device
            addresses of the  lines.  Any number of lines  can be selected.

            Only one address for each pair of lines need be specified (that
            is, one transmit or one receive).   To specify the data pattern
            to be used in this test, enter  one of  the  following  options
            (upper case characters) on the terminal:
            -----------------------

              1. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
              2. N
              3. P

            The first option, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  (16 hexadecimal digits), is
            the operator-specified  data pattern.  All  lines are  sent the
            first quarter of the data (one  halfword), followed by the sec-
            ond,  third, and  fourth quarters.   This  routine is  repeated
            until the test is halted.

            The second  option, N,  specifies a  decrementing data  pattern
                                _
            which starts  at FFFF  and decrements  by 1  to 0000.   This is
            repeated until the test is halted.

            The third  option, P,  specifies an  incrementing data  pattern
                               _
            which starts  at 0000  and increments  by 1  to FFFF.   This is
            repeated until the test is halted.

            Test 8 will run until halted by  pressing the Escape key on the
            terminal (when a loop value of 1  is in effect).  If either the
            N or the  P option is selected,  the program will take  about 6
            _         _
            minutes to cycle through all the  data patterns.  If the opera-
            tor-selected data pattern is used,  the program will take about
            14  milliseconds to  cycle through  the  data patterns.   These
            times are  for 16  synchronous lines at  4800 baud.   Note that
            when  the last  data pattern  is  used, the  test is  repeated,
            starting with the first data pattern.


            Note  that the  scope will  show a  up and  down  flushing data
            pattern on the tested lines about one second  before displaying
            the operator selected test pattern.

                                  9.9  Test 9


            This is the  enhanced selectable data test.  It is  the same as
            Test 8, except that  both I/O interrupts and  enhanced synchro-
            nous  interrupts are  enabled.  See  Section  9.8, Test 8,  for
            details.

            The test  will run until halted  by pressing the Escape  key on
            the terminal, if  a loop value of  1 is in effect  (see Section
            8.1.3, Abort Testing).  If either the N or the P option is used
                                                  _        _
            in selecting  the test data,  it will  take about 6  minutes to
            cycle through all the data patterns.  If the 16-digit operator-
            selected data pattern is used, then the program will take about
            14  milliseconds to  cycle through  the  data patterns.   These
            times are  for 16  synchronous lines at  4800 baud.   Note that
            when the  last data  pattern is used,  the test  repeats itself
            using the first data pattern.


            Note  that the  scope will  show a  up and  down  flushing data
            pattern on the tested lines about one second  before displaying
            the operator selected test pattern.







                                 9.10  Test 10


            This is  the control line selectable  data test.  This  test is
            intended for  use as  a scope loop  and is  the same  as Test 8
            except for the following:

              o  I/O interrupts are not enabled.

              o  Only  the control  lines (addresses  BF  and FF)  are
                 tested.

              o  The program asks for each  control line address sepa-
                 rately.  A response of either upper character YES  (Y)
                 or NO (N) must be entered at the  terminal  (without a
                 <CR>).

            Test 10  will run  continuously until  halted  by pressing  the
            Escape key on  the terminal if a  loop value of 1  is in effect
            (see Section 8.1.3, Abort Testing).

                            10 -  ERROR DESCRIPTIONS


            If the program  detects an  error, an error  code will  be dis-
            played on the terminal (with the MSG or ERRMSG command, and the
            NOHLT command enabled), while the test continues to run.  Addi-
            tional information may be sent to the  terminal if the DMP com-
            mand is enabled.   If the HLT command is  enabled, however, the
            program halts, awaits operator intervention,  and will not con-
            tinue testing.  The program must  then be restarted by pressing
            the RUN key on the console.  A  prompt will be displayed on the
            terminal.

            Error codes are  defined in the following  sections.  The error
            code format is as follows:

                 nnyy

            where nn  is the number of  the test that failed  (in decimal),
                  __
            and yy is the code for the  specific error.  If the value of nn
                __
            is 00, no test was running when the error occurred.

            If an  error occurs  and both  the DMP  and NOHLT  commands are
            enabled, additional information may be  displayed on the termi-
            nal.  For data errors, the data  received (the full contents of
            the receive buffer) and the  data expected are displayed.  Note
            that the  receive buffer  will contain  several halfwords  that
            were received before  the transmitted data was  received.  This
            is  because the  receive and  transmit  interrupts are  enabled
            simultaneously.  The expected  data should appear by  the sixth
            halfword received.   If not, it is  an error (that is,  this is
            what caused the error message).

                         10.1  Unexpected System Errors


            Unexpected system error messages are displayed on the terminal.
            The program halts after reporting the error and is restarted by
            pressing RUN  on the console.  A  prompt will be output  to the
            terminal.

            Error codes F0 to FF are reserved for unexpected system errors,
            which are as follows:

            Valid commands for  this diagnostic are summarized  here.  Some
            commands have parameters, and some  do not.  For those commands
            which have parameters,  a default condition will  be assumed if
            no parameters  are entered.  A  <CR> must always  terminate the
            command line.  See Section 8 for detailed command descriptions.
