        4.8 SGN.STRING and INT.STRING            __________ ___ __________

        Syntax:  INT.STRING(s) and SGN.STRING(s)
                 where s is any valid NAD/ASCII string constant

        Description:   These  statements  declare  string  constants  for
                 checking  host  output  to  verify  signoff  and  output
                 interrupt status, respectively.  If SGN.STRING is absent
                 in   HIF,   a   nominal   default  is  supplied  AC.SGN,
                 SGN.STRING's  child  macro,  if   no   LN.LOGOFF(SIGNOF)
                 appears.   If  SGN.STRING is absent in TIF, child AC.SGN
                 is defaulted.  The  latter  case  is  trivial.   Warning
                 level  defaults/redefines  arise  if  1)  s  is null, 2)
                 INT.STRING is omitted or SGN.STRING omitted in HIF  when
                 needed,  3) either statement recurs, 4) level isn't slot
                 level when statement occurs.

                 These are slot level statements.  As noted, s should not
                 be  null.   For HIF usage, care should be taken to match
                 actual host  output  under  the  circumstances  outlined
                 above.  (The child macro for INT.STRING is called AC.INT
                 and elicits NAD's AC /s/ statement, as does AC.SGN.)

                 In  TIF,  the  INT.STRING  macro  sets  up  the   string
                 displayed if the user enters message wait.  In addition,
                 it supresses one host frame containing it, if  the  host
                 must  reply  for  ETE  message  wait.   The latter event
                 supresses further searching for string s in host frames.

        Default:   INT.STRING  at  warning  level  only   (if   omitted.)
                 SGN.STRING  at  warning level if needed;  yes in TIF and
                 depending on LN.LOGOFF in HIF, if omitted.
