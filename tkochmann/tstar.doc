                 INSTALLATION AND FAULT ISOLATION MANUAL

                        PRELIMINARY, MARCH - 1986












1.0  INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this document is to assist those concerned personnel,
with the installation and maintenance of the TYMSTAR equipment.  The
trouble-shooting of this equipment will also be covered in this docu-
ment in later sections.

TYMSTAR is the name given for the product developed jointly by TYMNET 
and SATELLITE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY, INCORPORATED (referred to from
this point on as STM).  STM is located in Torrance, California.

1.1  GENERAL OVERVIEW

TYMSTAR is a product which utilizes the current technology provided by
the advances made in KU BAND satellite communications.  In effect, the
local TELCO operating company is by-passed, and we now are offering the
customer a "single vendor solution", in regards to installation, main-
tenance and trouble-shooting of their data communications network.

1.1.1  NETWORK OVERVIEW

TYMSTAR is comprised of the following major hardware components:

     -CENTRAL HUB

     -SATELLITE TRANSPONDER
     
     -MICRO-EARTH STATION
     
     -TXR-2100

1.2  CENTRAL HUB

The central hub, is the fulcrum of the network.  It acts as a "switching,
multiplexing and routing center".  Data is passed through the network in
relationship to the central hub as OUTBOUND and INBOUND channels.  

1.2.1  OUTBOUND CHANNELS

In the outbound mode, data is time division multiplexed and is broadcast
on a wideband channel to all the remote micro earth stations at once.
This single channel is composed of multiplexed sub-channels which will
contain both packet transmission and circuit routing information.  The
transfer rate is variable from the central hub (dependent upon network
requirements), anywhere from 256 KBPS to 15 MBPS.  Initially the outbound
channel will transmit at 512 KBPS.  For every 512 KBPS outbound channel, 
four (4) inbound channels are allowed.

1.2.2  INBOUND CHANNELS

The inbound channel is at a fixed rate of 96 KBPS.  The inbound channel 
uses the TDMA (time division multiple access) technique, with the informa-
tion grouped and sent in bursts.  Each burst is comprised of one or more 
packet(s) of information, with each packet containing a preamble, address  
and control information, user data and postamble.

1.3  SATELLITE TRANSPONDER

The satellite transponder is located on G STAR-1, geosynchronously orbiting
the Earth at longitude 105 degrees.  The transponder is KU band, and it acts
as an amplifier and repeater.  The amount of transponder capacity is depend-
ent upon the amount of bandwidth required.

1.4  MICRO-EARTH STATION 
    
The micro earth station is an offset gregorian antenna design, and is com-
prised of the following basic components:

     -FRAME STRUCTURE

     -LARGE REFLECTOR ANTENNA (1.2 METERS)

     -SMALL ELIPSOID or SUB-REFLECTOR ANTENNA

     -RF PACKAGE (RADIO FREQUENCY)

The frame structure is made with 3.5" pipe assembly, which is bolted to
the base pedestal.  The base pedestal must be firmly secured to a flat
surface.  The base frame (the 3.5" pipe assembly), in turn has the frame
assembly connected to it.  By attaching the cross arms to the frame ass-
embly the large reflector antenna can then be mounted.  The sub-reflector
antenna is mounted towards the front of the frame assembly.  The frame
assembly has a cradle for the RF package, which rests below, and to the
front of the large reflector antenna.  Finally, a turnbuckle connects to
the base and frame assemblies.

1.4.1  COMPONENT RELATIONSHIP

The base frame provides horizontal movement (AZIMUTH) for the micro earth
station.  The turnbuckle provides vertical movement (ELEVATION).  The RF
package provides cylindrical axis movement (POLARIZATION).  Azimuth and
elevation are used to align the micro earth station to the satellite.  

The RF package contains radio microwave equipment and has two (2) end cap
assemblies.  The front end cap has a feedhorn, which is a special trans-
mission waveguide, used to pick up and carry signals through the RF unit.
Also, the front end cap has a scale, marked in degrees, used for setting
the polarization.  The rear end cap has three (3) connectors marked POWER,
RX OUT and RX IN.  The RX OUT and RX IN connectors carry signals from the
TXR-2100 to the RF package.  RX OUT IS THE RECEIVE SIGNAL AND RX IN IS THE
TRANSMIT SIGNAL TO THE CENTRAL HUB.  The power connector carries +24 VDC
signals used to power the RF package.  In addition, it also carries a plus
and minus burst control signals that control the transmitter.  The transmit
and receive cables are coaxial with male type-N connectors on each end.  The
power cable is "8 conductor" with Amphenol connectors.  All three (3) cables
are combined into one (1) assembly and is called an "extruded" cable.  The
cable terminations are weatherproofed on the outdoor connectors.

1.5  TXR-2100

The TXR-2100 is the INDOOR equipment and comes as a desktop chassis model.
Internally, it contains the equipment supplied by STM and TYMNET's HDLC
micro-engine.  Externally, the front of the TXR-2100 has eight (8) indicator 
lights denoting the current conditon of the link to the central hub (these  
indicators will be covered in the INSTALLATION SECTION) and a power and boot
LED for the HDLC micro-engine.  The rear of the chassis has the following:

     -Twenty (20) female DB-25 connectors

     -Twelve (12) DB-25 expansion port connectors

     -The RX and TX connectors

     -The IFL (INTER-LINK FACILITY) cable plug connector

     -The 115 VAC power cord receptacle

     -The CONSOLE power connector

     -The BATTERY BACK-UP connector

     -The VIDEO connector

     -The FUSE receptacle

     -The ON/OFF switch

     -The TYMNET BOOT switch

     -The STM RESET switch

The TXR-2100 is approximately 19 1/2" across, 9" high and 26" in length.  It
has accomodations for four (4) ASYNC SIO ports, ten (10) FULL DUPLEX SYNC SIO  
ports, one (1) MULTIFUNCTION port, two (2) STM RECEIVE ONLY BROADCAST ports,
(2) STM FULL DUPLEX ports, one (1) VIDEO and one (1) STM DIAGNOSTIC port.  The 
STM diagnostic channel is used exclusively by STM.  SIO ports 8/9 are used in
conjunction with the STM full duplex ports (i.e. node code is loaded via these
ports).

2.0  INSTALLATION

Upon arriving at the customer's location, all the necessary pre-site steps
should have been completed.  For verification purposes, go through all the
items listed in the PRE-SITE INSTALLATION GUIDE.  If you have any questions,
call NTS.

2.1  INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS

STM document "TXR 2000 MICROSTAR MICRO EARTH STATION INSTALLATION GUIDE, REV.
0. JANUARY 1986" should be read before you attempt to assemble the micro earth
station.  Chapter 3 deals with the actual installation.  You should also be in
possession of the installation kit.  If not, notify your manager.

2.2  ASSEMBLY HINTS

The purpose of this section, is to provide to you some practical and helpful
hints on assembling and aligning the micro earth station.  It will also cover
what steps need to be performed on the TXR-2100 before turning it over to the
customer.

2.2.1  HINTS

01)  Follow the procedures documented in the STM INSTALLATION GUIDE for the
     type of install you are doing (i.e. roof top, sloped, parking lot etc.).

02)  All the nuts and bolts must be firmly tightened.  When you have completed
     the assembly, the micro earth station should be completely rigid.

03)  The alignment of the antenna is the most critical part of the assembly.

     a.  Do not completely tighten the clamp plate to the base frame, as per
         the manual.  Instead, tighten the bolts so that enough torque is on
         each of the bolts to permit the base frame assembly to move left to
         right (AZIMUTH) in incremental steps.  This allows you to fine tune
         the earth station for the maximum signal strength.

         NOTE:  THE DEGREES FOR YOUR AZIMUTH ON THE INSTALLTION SHEET ARE FOR
                MAGNETIC NORTH.  EITHER SUBTRACT OR ADD THE DECLINATION FOR
                YOUR AREA TO FIND TRUE NORTH.  IF YOU DO NOT KNOW THE ANGLE,
                USE THE COMPASS TO POSITION THE ANTENNA TO THE DEGREES GIVEN
                AND THEN SWEEP THE HORIZON UNTIL YOU LOCATE THE "FOOT PRINT"
                AS SHOWN IN THE INSTALLTION MANUAL, PAGE 3-19.

     b.  When attaching the turnbuckle to frame assembly and the base frame,
         place the protractor on the forward tubing of the frame assembly.
         Then roughly adjust to the desired degrees (ELEVATION) by aligning
         the turnbuckle to the appropriate holes in the base assembly and the
         frame assembly.

         NOTE:  A FIVE (5) DEGREE INCLINE IS BUILT INTO THE FRAME ASSEMBLY.
                SUBTRACT 5 DEGREES FROM THE THE ELEVATION SPECIFIED ON THE
                INSTALLATION SHEET.

     c.  The RF package should be the last item installed.  Place it on to the 
         cradle, and be sure that it is flush against it.  Do not fully tighten
         the metal bands holding the RF package in place since you will do that
         after determining the maximum signal strength for your polarization.

         NOTE:  THE SCALE ON THE FRONT ENDCAP IS READ IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
                WHEN VIEWED FROM THE FRONT OF THE FEEDHORN.  THE POLARIZATION
                STATED ON THE INSTALLATION SHEET WILL BE A PLUS OR MINUS FROM
                THE ZERO MARK.  TO SET A (+) POLARIZATION, ROTATE THE UNIT TO
                THE RIGHT OR CLOCKWISE.  TO SET A (-) POLARIZATION, ROTATE 
                THE UNIT TO THE LEFT OR COUNTER-CLOCKWISE.  THESE ROTATIONS 
                ARE DONE FROM THE ZERO MARK.  THE SCALE IS BELOW THE FEEDHORN
                WHEN VIEWED FROM THE FRONT OF THE RF PACKAGE.
      
2.3  TXR-2100 PRE-INSTALLATION CHECK-OUT

The TXR-2100 will be tested by STM, prior to shipment.  Before installing the
TXR-2100, disassemble the unit, and verify that all the cards are seated.  If
any cards are loose, reseat them.  Next, check the options associated with 
the HDLC micro-engine for your particular installation.  Consult the instal-
lation sheet for the customer's DTE requirements.  Reassemble the TXR-2100,
and load diagnostics into the HDLC micro-engine.  If any diagnostic fails to
run, replace that board which is in question and re-run the diagnostic.  If
the problem persists, call NTS.

2.4  SYSTEM INTEGRATION

If you have completed the steps up to section 2.3, you are now ready to com-
plete the final portion of the installation.  

NOTE:  NEVER CONNECT OR DISCONNECT THE IFL CABLE WITH POWER APPLIED TO THE
       TXR-2100.  A GOOD POSSIBILITY OF BLOWING THE MC3487 LINE DRIVER CHIP
       WILL OCCUR!

2.4.1  OUTDOOR UNIT

Connect all the cables to the RF package, except for the RX cable.  On this
connector, attach your spectrum analyzer with your jumper cable.  Set the 
dials on the spectrum analyzer to those shown on page 3-19, Table 4, of the
STM Installation Guide.  Turn on the power to the spectrum analyzer.  Next,
attach all the cables to the TXR-2100 and apply AC power to the unit.  Do
not forget which cables you are using for TX and RX.

Begin sweeping the horizon in incremental steps, until you locate the "FOOT
PRINT" as shown on page 3-20, Figure 3-10, of the STM Installtion Guide. 
Once you have found the signal, determine the maximum signal strength that
you can derive for your installation.

Call the central hub to verify the signal strength that they are receiving.
If any adjustments need to be made, do them at this time according to the
instructions given by the central hub.  As you become more experienced at
installing the equipment, proper AZIMUTH and POLARIZATION for your site will
be constant, once you have found the strongest signal and the only adjustment
to be made will be in regards to ELEVATION.  What this means, is that, having
found the signal for your installation, minute changes to the AZIMUTH and the
POLARIZTION should be performed, and then those bolts holding the base clamp 
and the metal straps should be tightened, while still retaining the maximum 
signal strength.  Once this is completed, you can then peak the signal using
the turnbuckle.  After you have done this, remove the spectrum analyzer and
connect the RX cable to the RF OUT connector.

You should see all the indicator lights come on as explained on pages 3-23/24
of the STM Installation Guide.  If they do not come on as indicated, refer to
the trouble-shooting section of this document.

After you have found the maximum signal strength for your installation, as 
per the central hub, tighten the nuts for the turnbuckle.

2.4.2  INDOOR UNIT

If section 2.4.1 is complete, you can now either load code into the TXR-2100
or run a BERT to it, via the satellite link.  

2.4.2.1  BERT 

A properly aligned micro earth station will result in zero errors on a BERT 
to the central hub.  To run the BERT, attach a RED/BLUE box to DUPLEX port 1
on the rear of the TXR-2100.  Jumper pins 2/3 together, and ask the central
hub to connect the FIREBERD tester to your port.  If a high error rate occurs,
the central hub may request that you re-align the micro earth station.  If
this is requested, refer to section 2.4.1 until the lowest possible error rate
is obtained.

2.4.2.2  NODE CODE LOAD

If section 2.4.2.1 is acceptable, you can now load your node code.  To do this,
attach the ONE TO ONE DB-25 cable, provided with the TXR-2100, from DUPLEX port
1 to SYNC port 9.  If the load fails, refer to the trouble-shooting section of
this document.

2.4.3  DTE EQUIPMENT

After loading the node code successfully, attach the customer's DTE equipment
to the appropriate ports found in the TYMFILE for that node.  Make sure that
the customer can log in, and that they are satisfied with the installation.

If they have any questions, attempt to answer them to the best of your know-
ledge, and if further assistance is required call NTS.

2.5  INSTALLATION COMPLETION

If the above listed sections have been completed satisfactorily, then close
out the project installation sheet.  If problems still exist, refer to the
trouble-shooting portion of this document.

3.0  TROUBLE-SHOOTING

This section will deal primarily with fault isolation and the steps necessary
to rectify the problem(s) associated with the micro earth station.  Problems
with the public network or user equipment will not be covered at this time.

Faults can occur within the following categories:

     -CENTRAL HUB

     -SATELLITE TRANSPONDER

     -CABLES

     -TXR-2100/HDLC MICRO-ENGINE

     -RF PACKAGE

After a brief description of what to do in case of problems, we will cover 
the possible scenarios which can go wrong with the mirco earth station, and
NOT the central hub, satellite transponder or the HDLC micro-engine.

3.1  CENTRAL HUB

If a problem occurs, first verify with NSSC or NETCON the exact nature of the
problem.  If you are required to call the central hub, dial (213)618-6800 and
ask for the network operator.  Calling STM in the case of a central hub prob-
lem will only delay them in restoring service to all customers.

If you have any questions, call NTS.

3.2  SATELLITE TRANSPONDER

These problems will be handled by the central hub.  The only time you will be
called on a problem of this type, is if for some reason, the satellite itself
is moved, and you are then required to re-align the micro earth station.  If
such is the case, refer to the installation portion of this guide.

If you have any questions, call NTS.

3.3  CABLES

Prior to running the cables, continuity should be checked by the mechanical
contractor or yourself.  If at all possible, a VSWR (VARIABLE SWEEP WAVE RATIO)
reading should be taken for the coaxial cables.

3.3.1 IFL CABLE

To verify continuity on the IFL cable, loopback pins 1-7 on either end of the
cable, and measure the corresponding pins on the other end of the cable.  If
a problem exists, request from STM a new cable for your installation.  Do not
attempt to repair the cable since it is weatherproofed and breaking the seal
on the outdoor portion of the cable destroys this integrity.

3.3.2  COAXIAL CABLES

Continuity and return loss over the coaxial cables are the measurements that
are made after the manufacturing process.  This is accomplished by terminating
the coaxial cable with a 50 ohm terminator and connecting to the opposite end 
a VSWR meter.  Briefly, the VSWR sends a signal down the length of the cable 
at the desired frequency and this signal is reflected back to the VSWR.  This
signal is then compared with the original for return loss.
 
NOTE:  IF THE INSTALLED COAXIAL CABLES EXCEEDED THE MAXIMUM BEND RADIUS (THIS
       10 TIMES THE DIAMETER OF THE CONDUCTOR OR 4" FOR RG213 AND 2 1/4" FOR
       RG223) YOU WILL EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF SIGNAL.
 
3.4  TXR-2100/HDLC MICRO-ENGINE

Because the TXR-2100 is an integration of TYMNET and STM equipment, we will 
not cover fault isolation of the TYMNET equipment, since you should already
be familiar with trouble-shooting problems of this nature.  If the problem
is isolated to the STM equipment, initially you will be required to swap out
the whole unit.  If the problem is with the HDLC micro engine the same holds
true, but if you can isolate the problem to a particular component of the 
HDLC micro engine replace that portion if spares are available to you.  

If you have any questions, call NTS.

3.5  RF PACKAGE

If the RF package is found to be bad, call STM for a replacement.  Never try
to open the RF unit since it too is weatherproofed.  Also, be careful of not
resting the RF unit on the mylar cover of the feedhorn.  If the mylar is cover
broken, obtain a replacement from _______________.

If you have any questions, call NTS.

3.6  PROBLEM SCENARIOS

Fault isolation on a micro earth station is relatively simple, and u be-
come more familiar with the equipment, you will notice that trouble-shooting
a problem is no different than the logical steps you currently take to find a
problem on a four-wire circuit.

As a baseline for the problem scenarios, we will assume that the equipment 
was tested at STM prior to shipment and that diagnostics were run on the HDLC
micro-engine.  In other words, we will assume that the installation portion 
has been completed.

If this is a new install, refer to the STM Installation Guide, and section 2
of this document.

If you have any questions, call NTS.

3.6.1  WHERE TO BEGIN

The first place to check on any problem will be with the TXR-2100.  Check to
see that no cables are loose and that power is supplied to the unit.  If no
power is present then check the fuses.  If replacing the fuses does not fix
the problem, then check the AC outlet in which the unit is plugged into.  If
power is present, and the power cord is good, replace the TXR-2100.  If no
power is present, then refer the problem to the customer for correction.

3.6.2  RED INDICATORS

If either the TDM or ALM indicators are on, first check with the central hub.
It is possible that they are having a problem.  If no problems exist there,
connect your spectrum analyzer to the RX cable with a center frequency of 
1017.5 MHZ.  If no signal is present, connect the analyzer to the TX cable,
since it is possible that someone switched cables.  If the receive signal is
is present, then use this coaxial cable as your new RX cable.  If no signal is
present on either cable then normal up the cables as they were originally.

3.6.2.1

Power off the TXR-2100 and remove the IFL cable from its connector.  Power on
the TXR-2100.   Measure pins 5, 6 and 7 for +24 VDC.  If the voltage readings
are present power off the TXR-2100 and reconnect the IFL cable.  If any of the
voltages are missing, obtain a replacement TXR-2100 from ____________.

3.6.2.2

Connect your spectrum analyzer to the TX connector on the rear of the TXR-2100.
Set the analyzer to the following settings:

     -CENTER FREQUENCY OF 785 MHZ

     -FREQUENCY SPAN OF 1 MHZ

     -RESOLUTION BANDWIDTH OF 100 KHZ

     -INPUT ATTENUATION OF 40 dB

     -REFERENCE LEVEL OF +10 dBm

The signal displayed should be comparable as with your hand-out.  This is the
burst modulator signal.  Adjust the waveform so that the peak of the signal is
at the top of the CRT display graticule.  The waveform should cover about 6 to
7 graticule divisions.  If it does, this means the the output power of the TXR-
2100 is at +10 dBm (+/- 1 dB) and it is within the specifications set by STM. 
If the signal is not present or out of range, then obtain a replacement unit
from ________________.

3.6.2.3

If the 785 MHZ signal was within specifications, change your CENTER FREQUENCY 
to 20 MHZ and the REFERENCE LEVEL TO 0 dBm.  The signal displayed should be
comparable as with your hand-out.  This signal is the frequency reference that
is phase locked to the recovered clock from the demodulator.  This waveform is
outputting at +2 dBm (+/- 5 dB) when it is within specification and ON.  If 
the signal is not present or out of range, then obtain a replacement TXR-2100
from __________________.

3.6.3
 
Go to the RF unit and connect the analyzer to the RX OUT connector on the rear
endcap.  If the +24 VDC were present at the indoor connector, you should see
the noise reference level rise on the analyzer's CRT.  If it does not rise,
then check to make sure the voltages are present on IFL cable.  If they are
present, and the level does not rise, you have a bad RF unit.  If they were
present inside, but not outside, then you have a bad IFL cable.  In either
case, you will have to call STM for a replacement.

3.6.3.1

If the noise level rises in 3.6.2.2, the footprint should be present on the
RX connector.  If the signal is not there, check the AZIMUTH, ELEVATION and
POLARIZATION of the micro earth station.  Refer to the installation section
of this document.  If those figures are correct you then have a bad RF unit.
Obtain a replacement unit from ___________________.

3.6.4  RETRANSMISSIONS

This is normally reported as slow response by the user.  If the central hub
determines that retransmissions are occurring for a particular micro earth
station, and weather is not the cause of the problem a re-verification of the
RX and TX signals will be required.  Refer to sections 2.4.1, 3.6.2.2 and
3.6.2.3 and follow the recommended resolution.

4.0  PROBLEMS NOT COVERED

If a problem arises and it is not covered in this document, call NTS for
assistance.  Because this type of networking is new for TYMNET, it is quite
possible for problems to develop which have not been seen before, so do not
be afraid to call and ask for support.  I am sure that all problems that may
occur in the future, will be resolved in a manner satisfactory to all those
concerned.

5.0  SUMMARY

This document has been written is very general terms, although it is the in-
tention of the author to be as specific as possible, when possible.  Since,
this document is being written about prototype equipments  (i.e. TXR-2100),
it is hard to write documentation for it.  The basic principles for isolating
a problem will still be valid, although at some later date in time, I am sure
that this document will be revised.  Just remember one thing, if you are at a
loss for ideas, do not hesitate to contact me at (800)538-3158, or ONTYME me
at EMSNTS;NTS.E/BLAIR.
