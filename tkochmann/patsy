Patsy:

	Please implement the following changes to the PICO installation
at Coors:

  I.	Remove the emulated sync line from Node Code.

 II.	Install a V.24 network connection to physical channel 0
	which is by design most appropriate for the modem network link.

III.	Assign channels 1 - 2 for the X.25 Access Layer and specify
	clock sources for the HDLC/DMA and HDLC/INT channels.

 IV.	Assign channels 3 - 4 for the ATI Consat.

  V.	Assign channels 5 - 7 for the AHI Tymcomm.

	These changes suggest a more beneficial use of PICO for the
assigned tasks.  Network Engineering needs to schedule a project to
perform the upgrade for an SIO neighbor connection.  With the load
that you will sustain on the IOC by using the interrupt intensive
async and tymsync channels probability is high that the network line
will be underrun when in full service and drop out of the network.  If
you had a secondary network line this would be not quite so severe but
you do have a dead ended node here!  Even though the PICO has been up
for the last 114 days I see there has been no real load put to it as
of yet.  My suggested changes are not optional as we can not guarantee
that the node on the Tymsync network line will perform acceptably
with the configuration that I reviewed today.  PICO is being ECO'ed
at this time to increase the reliability of the Tymsync protocol but
it still will perform much better on HDLC lines.
