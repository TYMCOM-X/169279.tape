SECTION I.


        INTRODUCTION TO THE PARADYNE 19.2 MODEM:
        ----------------------------------------

THE VHS 192 MICROPROCESSOR MODEM, TYMNET P/N 600098-001, TRANSMITS AND
RECEIVES HIGH-SPEED 19,200 BITS PER SECOND (BPS) SYNCHRONOUS DATA OVER D1
CONDITIONED TYPE 5 (3002) TELEPHONE LINES IN FULL-DUPLEX, POINT-TO-POINT
APPLICATIONS.  THE MODEM IS PACKAGED IN A STRUCTURAL FOAM CASE MEASURING 17.5
INCHES WIDE, 6.68 INCHES HIGH AND 17.5 INCHES DEEP, CONTAINING SPACE FOR SEVEN
FULL-SIZE CIRCUIT CARD ASSEMBLIES, A MOTHERBOARD, INTERFACE ASSEMBLY
CONNECTORS, AND A POWER SUPPLY ASSEMBLY.  THE MODEM CAN OPERATE AT THE
FOLLOWING DATA SPEEDS:

        19,200 BPS
        16,800 BPS
        14,400 BPS
        12,000 BPS
         9,600 BPS




THE MODEM HAS THE OPTION FOR A BUILT-IN EYE PATTERN GENERATOR THAT PROVIDES A
INDICATION OF THE QUALITY OF BOTH THE TELEPHONE LINES AND THE MODEM EQUIPMENT.
THE EYE PATTERN CAN BE USED TO DIAGNOSE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SIGNAL
IMPAIRMENTS:

        1) SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO
        2) PHASE JITTER
        3) HARMONIC DISTORTION
        4) AMPLITUDE MODULATION
        5) GAIN HITS
        6) IMPULSE NOISE HITS
        7) FREQUENCY OFFSET

THE MODEM CAN BE MOUNTED ON A STANDARD 19-INCH EQUIPMENT SHELF, BUT CARE MUST
BE TAKEN TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SPACING BETWEEN EACH MODEM SO THAT EXCESSIVE
HEAT DOES NOT DAMAGE THE MODEMS.

THE MODEM'S HEAT DISSIPATION IS 221.84 BTU/HR. THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE
IS 32 DEGREES (0C) TO 122 DEGREES F (50C). RELATIVE HUMIDITY SHOULD
BE AT 5% TO 90% (NONCONDENSING).


SECTION II.

        SITE PREPARATION FOR THE 19.2 MODEM:
        ------------------------------------

 THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES SHOULD BE USED WHEN PREPARING TO INSTALL A
 PARADYNE 19.2 MODEM:

1) CAUTION: THE E.I.A. CABLE CAN NOT BE MORE THEN 25 FEET IN LENGTH. THIS MEANS
   THAT THE DISTANCE FROM THE MODEM TO THE DTE (TYMNET/COMPUTER), SHOULD
   BE PRE-PLANNED SO THAT ONLY A 25 FT. OR LESS WILL BE NEEDED TO CONNECT
   THE DTE EQUIPMENT TO THE DCE EQUIPMENT.

2) IF THE CABLE LENGTH MUST BE LONGER THEN 25 FT., A LOW CAPACITANCE TYPE
   CABLE CAN BE USED FOR THE CABLE RUN. THE MAXIMUM LENGTH FOR THE LOW
   CAP. CABLE IS 150 FEET. THE TYMNET P/N FOR THE LOW CAP CABLE IS 600105-TAB

3) IF THE TELCO D-MARC IS TOO FAR AWAY FROM A "NEW" (OTHER THEN THE EXISTING
   LOCATION) INSTALLATION AREA, NEW 4-WIRE WIRING SHOULD BE ROUTED TO THE
   LOCATION.

4) MAKE SURE THERE IS ROOM FOR THE 19.2 MODEM IN ANY CABINETS THAT MAY BE
   USED IN THE INSTALLATION. ALSO MAKE SURE PROPER VENTILATION IS MAINTAINED
   (NOTE: SEE INTRODUCTION TO THE 19.2 FOR MORE SPECIFICATIONS)

5) MOST OF THE 19.2 INSTALLATIONS WILL BE ON TYMNET SWITCHERS USING TWO
   (2) 9.6 BPS DOUBLE LINE LINKS. TYMNET PROJECT REPORTS WILL BE STATING
   WHICH TELEPHONE CIRCUIT WILL BE USED FOR THE 19.2 INSTALL. THE OTHER
   TELEPHONE CIRCUIT WILL BE CANCELED AS SOON AS WE SEE THAT THE 19.2
   CIRCUIT IS UP WITH NO PROBLEMS. WE MAY NEED TO MOVE THE 19.2 MODEM TO
   THE OTHER CIRCUIT IF THE FIRST CIRCUIT HAS PROBLEMS. JEAN SORCI WILL
   NEED TO BE NOTIFIED OF THIS MOVE TO THE OTHER CIRCUIT SO THAT WE DO
   NOT CANCEL THE WRONG CIRCUIT, AND TO KEEP THE RECORDS STRAIGHT.

6) IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE PARADYNE 19.2 MODEM BE INTERFACED WITH A SIO
   V.24 CARDS FOR GREATER CPU EFFICIENCY. BUT, IF NO V.24 INTERFACES ARE
   AVAILABLE ON THE ENGINES, SYNCHRONOUS BOARDS CAN BE USED TO INTERFACE
   THE 19.2 MODEM TO THE TYMNET ENGINE.






SECTION III.

        FIELD SERVICE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE:
        ---------------------------------------------------------------

1) TO INSURE THAT THE 19.2 MODEMS ARE INSTALLED ON THE DESIGNATED DATE AND
   TIME SCHEDULED BY TYMNET.

2) MUST INSURE THAT BOTH ENDS OF THE INSTALL MEET WITH A BIT ERROR RATE (BERT)
   OF NO MORE THEN 25 HITS IN A 20 MINUTE PERIOD, USING A 2047 BIT PATTERN
  FIELD SERVICE MUST RUN THE TEST FOR A MINIMUM OF 20 MIN. IF THE CIRCUIT DOES
   NOT PASS THIS SPECIFICATION, THE FIELD ENG. WILL NEED TO WORK WITH TYMNET AND
   OR THE TELEPHONE COMPANY TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM.


3) TO INSURE THAT THE TYMNET ENGINE PASSES ALL DIAGNOSTICS, AND THAT THE
   SIO V.24 INTERFACE PASSES DIAGNOSTICS.

4) TO INSURE THAT THE AREA THAT THE MODEM WILL BE INSTALLED AT IS PROPERLY
   VENTILATED, AND THAT THE CABLE RUNS ARE NOT TO EXCEED 25 FEET USING NORMAL
   CABLES, AND 150 FEET USING LOW CAP. CABLES.

5) ALL INSTALL ORDERS WILL BE THROUGH THE ORDER ENTRY SYSTEM. LEAH SETZER OF
   MCDONNELL DOUGLAS/TYMNET (408 946-5185), WILL BE WORKING WITH PAT EDDY OF
   PARADYNE SCHEDULING (415 571-1461) ON THE 19.2 INSTALL DATES AND TIMES. THE
   INSTALLS WILL BE ON EXISTING DOUBLE LINE 9.6 CIRCUITS ON TYMNET SWITCHERS.
   CIRCUIT CHOICE WILL BE DETERMINED BY WHICH OF THE TWO CIRCUITS HAS THE
   LEAST AMOUNT OF BIT ERRORS. A 2047 PATTERN BERT TEST WILL NEED TO BE RUN ON
   BOTH CIRCUITS FOR 20 MINUTES TO GIVE US A IDEA WHAT CIRCUIT IS THE BEST
   CANDIDATE FOR THE 19.2 MODEM. AFTER THE INSTALL OF THE MODEM, THE
   LINK WILL BE MONITORED FOR ANY PROBLEMS, IF A PROBLEM COMES UP THAT CAN NOT
   BE RECTIFIED BY TYMNET, PARADYNE OR THE TELEPHONE COMPANY, THE 19.2 MODEM
   WILL BE MOVED TO THE OTHER CIRCUIT TO SEE IF THE PROBLEMS ARE REDUCED.
   CANCELING OF ONE OF THE LINKS WILL BE DETERMINED AS SOON AS THE 19.2 LINK
   IS STABLE AND FULLY OPERATIONAL.


SECTION IV.

        TOOLS AND TEST EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
        --------------------------------------

THE FOLLOWING TOOLS AND TEST EQUIPMENT BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, WILL BE
NEEDED TO INSTALL AND VERIFY MODEM OPERATION, AND TYMNET OPERATION:


1) RED BOX WITH BERT TESTER.
2) FLAT HEAD SCREW DRIVER
3) H.P. TRANSMISSION IMPAIRMENT TESTER (TIMS) #4935 OR
   HALCYON 520B TEST SET
4) PARADYNE 19.2 MANUAL
5) SIO V.24 LOOPBACK PLUGS (FOR PSM CARDS AND OLD STYLE V.24 DAUGHTER CARDS).
6) SIODIA DIAGNOSTIC


SECTION V.

        STRAPPING GUIDE FOR THE 19.2 MODEM:
        -----------------------------------



THE FOLLOWING STRAPPING GUIDE STARTS OUT WITH BASELINE SETTINGS (I.E. NONE
OF THE LINE IMPAIRMENT COMPENSATIONS ARE ENABLED). THE PARADYNE 19.2 MODEM
HAS A NUMBER OF STRAP SELECTABLE IMPAIRMENT COMPENSATIONS THAT CAN BE ENABLED
AND THE "INSTALLATION HINTS" SECTION AT THE END TELLS HOW AND WHEN TO USE
THEM.

SECTION VI.

        INSTALLATION HINTS TO HELP IN THE 19.2 INSTALL:
        -----------------------------------------------


1) NOISE SUPPRESSION= DESIGNED TO CORRECT A SPECIFIC DEGRADATION THAT CAUSES AN
      &          INTOLERABLE BIT ERROR RATE (BERT). NORMALLY THESE SUPPRESSION
 PHASE JITTER    CIRCUITS ARE DISABLED, BUT YOU MAY WANT TO TRY THESE ONE AT
  S1-8,4         A TIME AND SEE IF THE BIT ERROR RATE CAN BE REDUCED.
   (RXMP)        THEN TRY BOTH CORRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME AND SEE IF THE
                 BIT ERROR RATE DROPS. REMEMBER THAT BOTH MODEMS MUST HAVE THE
                 SAME ERROR CORRECTIONS INSTALLED FOR PROPER OPERATION.

2) TRANSMIT PREEMPHASIS= THIS CAN BE ENABLED WHEN THE CIRCUIT LINE CONDITIONS
      S1-9               REQUIRE COMPENSATION FOR FREQUENCY RESPONSE. TRY THIS
     (RXMP)              ON THE MODEM END THAT IS RUNNING THE CLEANEST, SEE IF
                         THE OTHER MODEM HAS BETTER BIT ERROR RESPONSE AFTER
                         YOU ENABLED THIS CIRCUIT.

3) PRIMARY DATA RATE= IF THE 19.2 BPS DOES NOT RUN CLEANLY, TRY 14.4 BPS TO
   S2-1,2             SEE IF THE LINE RUNS BETTER. BUT, REMEMBER TO MAKE SURE
    (AGC)             THAT YOU GET THE CIRCUIT TO WORK USING 19.2 BPS.


SECTION VII.

        SPECIAL NOTES TO REMEMBER:
        --------------------------

1) MAKE SURE THAT BOTH MODEMS ON THE CIRCUIT HAVE THE SAME PROM VERSIONS. THIS
   CAN BE CHECKED BY LOOKING AT THE RXMP CARD AT THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS:

        LOCATIONS: B1, C1, D1, E1, B3, C3, D3, E3, A6, B6, C6.

    WE ARE NOW USING PROM VERSION P068A THAT USE A 3200 NUMBER. YOU MAY FIND
    A 3900 NUMBER WHICH IS THE  P068B VERSIONS. BOTH WILL WORK TOGETHER.

2) AFTER THE 19.2 HAVE BEEN INSTALLED, YOU WILL NEED TO CONTACT FRANK TROGLIONE
   (TYMOPS.FRANK) AND NOTIFY HIM THAT YOU HAVE REPLACED A MODEM WITH A PARADYNE
   19.2. HE WILL BE ABLE TO ARRANGE THE PLACEMENT OF THE SWAPPED OUT MODEM.

3) THE ENGINE TYMFILE SHOULD HAVE THE WINDOW SIZE SET FOR 8 ON THE 19.2
   SINGLE LINE LINK. BUT, IF WINDOW SIZE 12 WAS USED FOR THE 9.6 DOUBLE LINE
   LINK, YOU DO NOT NEED TO CHANGE IT TO WINDOW SIZE 8 FOR THIS RECONFIGURATION

5) IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO PLACE A "SHUT" ON THE CIRCUIT/LINK THAT WILL BE
   FOR THE 19.2 INSTALL. THE SHUT SHOULD BE PLACED ON THE LINK THE NIGHT
   BEFORE THE INSTALL. THIS WILL ALLOW TRAFFIC TO BE REROUTED TO
   OTHER LINKS.

6) AFTER THE 19.2 HAS BEEN INSTALLED, CHECK TO SEE IF THE LINK IS UP USING
   XRAY AND PROBE COMMANDS. MAKE SURE THE CRYPTO LOG SHOWS NO LINE DETACHES,
   AND THAT THE LINK HAS CIRCUITS BEING BUILT ACROSS IT. AFTER YOU ARE SATIS-
   FIED THAT THE LINK IS UP AND RUNNING PROPERLY, YOU WILL NEED TO SHUT OFF
   THE OTHER LINE (OF THE DOUBLE LINE LINK), SO THAT ALL THE DATA IS ON THE
   19.2 LINK.


7) **** DON'T FORGET THAT BOTH ENGINES ON THE 19.2 LINK WILL NEED VERSION 18
   MICROCODE ON THE ROM I/O BOARD, (P/N 380001-001). VERSION 17 OR LOWER WILL
   NOT SUPPORT 19.2KBS LINES.

SECTION VIII.

        TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS:
        ----------------------

1) MAKE SURE THAT THE TYMNET ENGINE IS USING VERSION 18 MICROCODE ON THE ROM
   BOARD. THIS MICROCODE VERSION IS NEEDED TO ALLOW FASTER INTERRUPT PROCESSING
2) VERIFY SIO MOTHER BOARD AND V.24 DAUGHTER CARD BY RUNNING DIAGNOSTICS SUCH
   AS SIODIA, (NTS)LINTST.BND. THESE DIAGNOSTICS WILL HELP IN DETERMINING THE
   PROPER OPERATION OF THE TYMNET END OF THE CONNECTION. YOU CAN PUT THE
   PARADYNE 19.2 MODEM (AT THE ENGINE END RUNNING THE DIAGNOSTIC) IN ANALOG
   LOOPBACK, AND LET THE TEST RUN TO VERIFY THE CABLING AND THE ENGINE. THEN
   YOU COULD HAVE THE FAR END MODEM PUT INTO DIGITAL LOOPBACK AND TEST BOTH
   MODEMS AND THE TELCO LINE.

3) MAKE SURE THE CABLE BETWEEN THE ENGINE AND THE MODEM IS NOT RUNNING ON
   TOP OF ANY POWER CORDS OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT COULD CAUSE INTERFERENCE.
   ALSO MAKE SURE ALL CONNECTIONS ARE SCREWED TIGHTLY TOGETHER.

4) YOU MAY NEED TO RUN A END TO END TEST USING THE RED BOX AND A 2047
   BERT PATTERN. MAKE SURE THAT THE LINE DOES NOT HAVE MORE THEN 25 HITS
   IN A 20 MINUTE PERIOD AT EITHER MODEM END. IF YOU GET MORE THEN 25 HITS
   IN THE 20 MINUTE TIME FRAME, WORK WITH THE TELEPHONE COMPANY ON VERIFYING
   THAT THE LINE MEETS THE 3002 D1 CONDITIONS. YOU MAY NEED TO USE THE
   H.P. OR HALCYON TEST SETS TO CHECK FOR CERTAIN LINE IMPAIRMENTS.

5) YOU MAY WANT TO TRY USING THE BUILT-IN EYE PATTERN GENERATOR IN THE MODEM.
   THIS CAN TELL YOU INTION ABOUT THE CIRCUIT, BUT YOU WILL NEED A
   OSCILLOSCOPE THAT HAS BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DISPLAYS. THE PARADYNE
   19.2 MANUAL WILL HELP EXPLAIN SOME OF THE EYE PATTERN DISPLAYS.
