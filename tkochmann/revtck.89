           PART 1 - CAREER INTERESTS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
 
       EMPLOYEE-COMPLETE THIS SECTION AND DISCUSS WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR
 ___________________________________________________________________________
 CAREER INTERESTS: Describe the type of work and identify the specific  jobs
 you would like to do.
 
 Short Range (1-2 years)
 I would like to continue in my current position throughout the next year or
 two.   I want to see a program established to bring in field people to work
 in NTS in a training capacity to get exposure to new projects and the daily
 troubleshooting for two or three weeks in conjuncture with the TTE training.
       Additionally I want to see the NTS labs set up to cover all levels of
 testing from IC bench level to full blown network applications testing in a
 structure  that  does not require radical destruction and reconstruction of
 lab test beds.  I also want to establish a comprehensive lab environment to
 use exclusively for analogue modem and digital data set testing.   In short
 I expect to raise the level of quality and technical expertise in  the  NTS
 group to surpass by far any previous level.

 Long Range (3-5 years)
 I want to move into a software/firmware support/development role within the
 next two to three years.  I would especially enjoy working on low level I/O
 drivers.
 ___________________________________________________________________________
 QUALIFICATIONS AND AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT: Summarize what you consider to be
 your work-related strengths or skills (interactive, administrative, techni-
 cal;  see  page  5  for descriptions) and identify areas for improvement as
 needed for career development.

I.  Interactive:    I enjoy "pooling" resources and working with others at all
    levels of expertise.  I recognize the value in listening to other people's
    suggestions and acting  on  them  as  well  as  the danger of listening to
    everyone's suggestions and trying to carry them all out.   I care a  great
    deal about the people I work with and tend to think of them as  part of my
    family which at times does pose a problem as I do try to protect them from
    the panics and political bombs that come our way.  

II. Administrative: To accomplish the short range tasks I need to concentrate
    more energy into administration of front line escalations and support  of
    field needs throughout the group.   At this time I find that I spend more
    time on low  level  troubleshooting and field/sales/STS/NTD/NTS technical
    support than on actual administrative tasks.

III.Technical:    I am able to use my technical knowledge and skills daily in
    accomplishing the tasks assigned to our group.        I have been able to 
    share this knowledege to assist others with their efforts and in exchange
    I find that my own knowledge and expertise is being expanded.
 ___________________________________________________________________________








 DEVELOPMENT PLANS: Identify specific action(s) that can be  implemented  to
 enhance your opportunity to achieve career goals.
 
 Keep me informed of projects and plans for NSC to the extent that I can in
 turn schedule group resources to meet the needs.  Permit me to acquire the
 tools we need to expand our scope of testing this next year.
 ___________________________________________________________________________
 TRAINING  REQUIREMENTS:  Identify training courses (self-directed or other-
 wise) that would complement the development plans as  defined  above.    If
 possible, specify proposed timetable.

 I would like one week's training at SUN to accelerate  my profiency on the
 SUN systems.  I also want to pick up more upper level calculus classes and
 perhaps a university level C programming class.   I especially would enjoy
 some LAN and ISDN seminars this year.  Should TTE offer any in-depth pro -
 gramming classes next year I should be scheduled to attend.

 
 
 
 Note: Development is a responsibility that is shared by both management and
 the employee.  Management is responsible for providing developmental oppor-
 tunities  that  reflect  the  needs  of  the employee and the organization.
 Employees are responsible for taking advantage of  the  opportunities,  in-
 cluding,  but not limited to,  on- or off-job study, additional special as-
 signments, transfers, etc.

 Technical  skills  that apply to a specific job rests with the employee and
 his/her manager.   The following are general indicators  of  how  Technical
 skills are applied:

                PART III - OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE
 
 Considering  the results of the employee's overall performance,  select the
 category that best describes the employee's  performance  during  the  past
 performance period.
 
 Due  to the competitive nature of the markets in which the Information Sys-
 tems Group companies compete,  all employees are  expected  to  perform  as
 described below:
 
 CONSISTENTLY MEETS AND AT TIMES EXCEEDS REQUIREMENTS (CM)
 
 Performance consistently meets and at times exceeds requirements and expec-
 tations.    The  employee  has  a  full knowledge of the job duties and ac-
 complishes these duties with demonstrated competence  in  the  interactive,
 administrative and technical aspects of the job.   The employee anticipates
 problems, initiates appropriate action, and obtains assistance when needed.
 Meets the high standards McDonnell Douglas requires of all employees.
 ___________________________________________________________________________
 
 Occasionally,  an employee's performance may differ from the expected  per-
 formance  level  during a given period.   Descriptions for these exceptions
 are listed below.
 
 MEETS MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS (MM)
 
 Performance meets minimum standards.   Competency in all aspects of the job
 has  not  been fully demonstrated.   The employee requires more than normal
 direction for complex or critical tasks.   At times  performance  may  fall
 below the acceptable level, requiring closer than normal supervision.
 
 DOES NOT MEET REQUIREMENTS (DN)
 
 Performance  is  below minimum expectations and standards,  requiring close
 supervision.   The employee should be on a performance improvement plan and
 termination  or reclassification will be considered if the improvement plan
 guidelines are not met.   The employee is not eligible for an increase  and
 will  remain  ineligible until performance is improved.   (This performance
 category is rarely assigned.)
 
 CONSISTENTLY EXCEEDS REQUIREMENTS (CE)
 
 Performance is marked by high quality and quantity of  work  which  exceeds
 expectations and position requirements on a regular basis.   Generally, as-
 signments are highly complex, and independent decisions and workable alter-
 natives can be depended on.   Only extraordinary problems are  referred  to
 management for assistance.
 
 CONSISTENTLY FAR EXCEEDS REQUIREMENTS (CFE)
 
 Performance  is  consistently  well beyond normal performance expectations.
 Judgment,  resourcefulness,  and depth of  knowledge  are  of  the  highest
 quality.  Contributes unique and innovative solutions to even the most dif-
 ficult  problems  and  repeatedly  makes  valuable contributions to the or-
 ganization.  (This performance category is rarely assigned.)
