SIO-ASYNC MODE

CHANNELS 0,1 ARE NONFUNCTIONAL IN ASYNC MODE...CHANNEL 1 WILL
RUN FOR A FEW PASSES OF DATA FROM THE HOST TO THE ATI TO THE
TERMINAL AND "HANG"...ISIS SHOWS APPLIED BACKPRESSURE.

CHANNELS 2,3 ARE PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL...XOFF STOPS IOC OUTPUT
TO THE TERMINAL BUT LEAVES THE ATI LOCKED UP IN AN XOFF MODE.
XON IS NONFUNTIONAL UNDER TESTING.  THE IOC ALSO "LOCKED UP"
DURING A CONTINUOUS ASYNC TEST.  THE ATI SENT A STREAM OF GBs/RBs
TO ISIS FOLLOWED BY A NOS(A0, NO SEND/APPLY BACKPRESSURE).  THIS
LOOKS AS IF IT IS RELATED TO THE SAME XOFF/XON BUG IN 1.23.


FRANK WU AND I PATCHED TO ASYNC TEST TO SEND AN ODD NUMBER OF BYTES
IN DSIO DURING THE ASYNC TEST AND CHANNEL 2 NOW FAILS WITH ABOUT THE
SAME FREQUENCY UNDER TEST 9 AS IT DOES WITH TYMSYNC TEST 5.  THE
ERROR REPORTED IN TEST 9 IS "EXPECTED SIO INTERRUPT WAS NOT RECEIVED".
AN ENGBUG STATUS DISPLAY OF CHANNEL 2 SHOWS NO ATN1 INTERRUPTS ARE
EVER LOST.

==================================================================

HDLC/DMA MODE

FRANK AND I ALSO PATCHED THE DMA TEST TO SEND AN ODD NUMBER OF BYTES
AND CHANNELS 0,1 FAIL THE FIRST TIME THROUGH THE TEST.  THE RECEIVED
DATA PATTERN IS ALWAYS 1 BYTE SHORT!  I KNOW THIS IS NO GREAT
SURPRISE NOW, BUT FRANKS TEST PROVIDES YOU WITH A QUICK, RELIABLE MEANS
OF EVALUATING THE DMA MODIFICATIONS RALPH AND COMPANY MAKE FOR TSI.
NANO,SKY IOC WITH THE DIAG BEFORE BRINGING THE SLOT INTERFACE TESTS
AGAIN.

============================================================================

HDLC/INT MODE

SDLC,X.25, AND NODE CODE ALL SEEM FAIRLY RELIABLE ON CHANNELS 2,3.  THE
MODIFICATIONS TO DSIO HAVE NO NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CHANELS 2,3 AS THEY DO
ON CHANNELS 0,1.  STILL OBSERVING FRAME REJECTS IN X.25 WITH MULTIPLE
CIRCUITS BUILT WITH THE THROUGHPUT HOST THAT DON'T SHOW UP IN THE MICRO
IV AND THE ENGINE ENVIRONMENT WITH THE SAME CODE.

=============================================================================

EMULATED SYNC/INT MODE

UTS TIF RUNS WITH NO HANDSHAKE SELECTED, FAILS WITH RTS/CTS,DTR/DSR
SELECTED.

3270 TIF ALSO LOCKS UP THE EMULATED SYNC CHANNELS REQUIRING A BOARD
RESET TO START THE CHANNELS RUNNING AGAIN AS IN THE UTS MODE.

NODE CODE RUNS ON EMUALTED SYNC LINES WITH NO EVIDENT COMPLAINTS
