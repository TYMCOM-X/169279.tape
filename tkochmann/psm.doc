      PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION, INSTALLATION AND TESTING PROCEDURES
   FOR THE PSM BUCKET AND ASSOCIATED HARDWARE (UNSWITCHED VERSION)


                           GENERAL


    The PSM is packaged in an aluminum card cage 19.0 inches wide,
12.25 inches high and 13.0 inches deep that contains a power supply
module, control card module, and various I/O interface modules. The
I/O interface modules may be of the SIO or NON-SIO variety.
    The Port Switch Module (PSM) is mounted on sliding racks inside
the Engine cabinets. The sliding racks allow the PSM unit(s) to be
pulled forward for access to rear ribbon cable connectors.
    The PSM will consolidate three components of the current Engine
system into one. It replaces the I/O connector panel, SIO daughter
board card cage, and front panel monitor assembly. The PSM is an in-
dependently powered and electrically isolated unit. It is com-
patible with the Engine in all electrical, mechanical, and cabling
aspects. The PSM draws less than 100 watts when fully loaded and may 
be powered from an ordinary wall outlet. The unit will have no U.L.
or municipal code problems since there is no exposed A.C. anywhere.
    A further description of the Tymnet Engine can be found in the
Tymnet Engine Maintenance Manual and Engine Documentation and for
this reason, just the Port Switch module will be discussed in detail
in the document.
    The engine system ground return does not satisfy all of the port
switch module's operating requirements. It is required that additional
precautions must be taken to insure a common return path for all elements
in the system. One configuration requirement is the installation of flat
braid cables between the engine and the port switch module that services
it. THIS IS NOT AN OPTIONAL REQUIREMENT!!
    There are currently two (2) EAR's on the PSM unit that are to
be implemented in the near future. One deals with removing the power
supply from the PSM unit itself as we can draw the power we need directly
from the engine. The other deals with depopulating the control card as
we do not need all the switching capabilities currently on it in our
unswitched environment.

CARD CAGE P/N 650015-001

    The card cage has 17.0 inches of usable width that is divided into
20 equally divided slots. Each slot can hold a vertically mounted circuit
module that is inserted from the front and held in place by top and bottom
captive mounting screws. Free convection cooling is achieved by vertically
mounting the circuit modules along with the top and bottom cooling vents
on the PSM card cage. This arrangement insures minimal thermal stress
on the existing internal Engine environment. All circuit modules will
connect to a backplane. Below is a diagram.

BACKPLANE P/N 430190-001

    The backplane is a center mounted strip across the back of the
card cage. The backplane provides the following traces for inter-
connection of circuit modules:

                 1.  D.C. POWER
                 2.  FOUR SIO BUSSES
                 3.  DEDICATED "HEARTBEAT" PORT
                 4.  MODULE CONNECTORS
                 5.  GROUND RETURNS

    The PSM's primary power supply provides D.C. voltage (+5,-5,+15,-15)
to all circuit modules via traces on the backplane. The backplane also
provides traces for signal return grounds.
A total of four SIO busses connect to the backplane via the control card.
The backplane of the PSM I/O section (16 slots) is divided into two 
sections. Each 8-slot section has 2-SIO busses on the backplane where one
will be switched between primary and backup and the other never will
be switched (unswitched).
    All PSM circuit modules are attached to the backplane by 96-PIN
DIN connectors.  Each circuit module is keyed to prevent improper
insertion of a module into a specific slot.

****************************I M P O R T A N T******************************

BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN PLUGGING IN THE CIRCUIT CARDS AS THE PINS ON
THE BACKPLANE ARE VERY EASILY BENT IF THE CARDS ARE NOT SEATED
PROPERLY.

***************************************************************************


POWER SUPPLY MODULE P/N 430216-001
FRONT PANEL # BKPS2

    The PSM primary power supply is plugged into the backplane connector
and occupies the 3-Left most slots of the card cage. It supplies regu-
lated voltages of +5,-5,+15,-15. The primary power supply is an 
enclosed, shielded, plug-in unit with a detachable A.C. power cord.
This circuit module is fully compliant with domestic and international
emission requirements.
    The front panel of the power supply has a pilot indicator (RED) to
indicate if power is being applied. The front panel also has a status 
light (GREEN) to indicate if supply is in "NORMAL MODE" or "FAILED MODE".  
    The connector on the rear of the primary power supply allows for
the connection of redundant or backup power sources. These connections
may be from one of three sources:

                    1.  ENGINE POWER SUPPLY
                    2.  EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLY
                    3.  BATTERY

    In the event of a primary power supply failure, circuitry on the
supply module will allow a backup supply to provide service automatic-
ally. If a failure occurs, a flag will be sent to the control card to 
inform the system of this malfunction.

Below are the locations you use to test the voltages on the power
supply. These checks can be made with the unit installed in the
card cage.

The only voltage we adjust is the +5 volts. The range is from
+5.15 to +5.35 volts. To adjust the voltage, pull the power
supply out from the backplane leaving the power cord attached
and powered up. You will only need to pull the supply out about
four (4) to five (5) inches. Look towards the bottom of the supply
for two (2) potentiometers labeled O.L. and V. ADJ. The V. ADJ switch
is the one to adjust the +5 volts.

CONTROL CARD P/N 430208-001
FRONT PANEL # BKCC1

     The Control Card is the intelligence of the PSM. It allows
monitoring capabilities for all of our cards less the OCL and V.35
as these are too fast.
     The card is installed in the right most slot of the PSM chassis.
The card will receive power once it has been seated into the backplane.
It has a number of connectors associated with different functions of
the card. The following are the connectors and the proper way of cabling.

     There are four (4), thirty-four (34) pin connectors labeled J2, 
J3, J4, and J5. These are used to connect the control card to the 
motherboard(s). They are all supposed to be keyed, if not, position
the cable (P/N 160193-XXX) with the red stripe down on the control
card, and to the right on the motherboard.

Below are their uses:

J2 = UNSWITCHED PRIMARY SIO BUS #1 ((MOTHERBOARD 80) RIGHT HALF OF CHASSIS)
J3 = BACK-UP SIO BUS #1 (NOT USED IN THE UNSWITCHED MODE)
J4 = UNSWITCHED PRIMARY SIO BUS #2 ((MOTHERBOARD 81) LEFT HALF OF CHASSIS)
J5 = BACK-UP SIO BUS #2 (NOT USED IN THE UNSWITCHED MODE)

     There are also four (4) other connectors on the card labeled J15,
J16, J17, and J18. These deal with the heartbeat logic and manual force.
We do not use these connectors in the unswitched environment.

     The card has a four (4) position switch and an eight (8) position
switch which are accessible from the front of the card. The four (4)
position switch deals with the PSM status and is addressed by pointing
the arrow in the direction of the selection you want. 

The four (4) positions are as follows:

FP = MANUAL FORCE PRIMARY MODE (TYMNET UNSWITCHED MODE)
FB = MANUAL FORCE BACK-UP MODE
S  = SLAVE MODE
N  = NORMAL MODE

    For our purposes in the Un-Switched mode of operation this switch
should always be in the "FP" position. The green "PRI" LED should be
flashing to indicate that it is indeed in the "PRI" mode of operation.

The eight (8) position switch deals with the port selection for monitoring
purposes and is addressed by positioning the flat part of the switch away 
from the address you want to select. The eight (8) position switch is 
numbered from one (1) to eight (8), and this is how you select which port 
you will be monitoring. A word of caution, not all cables are marked the 
same, so the following guide can be used:

  POSITION        CABLE
     1          0 = A = WHITE
     2          1 = B = GREEN
     3          2 = C = BLACK
     4          3 = D = RED
     5          4 = E
     6          5 = F
     7          6 = G
     8          7 = H

     The front of the card also has a group of eight (8) LED's which
allow you to monitor circuit status for both the Sync and Async lines.
The monitor cable (P/N 160159-009) is a fifty (50) pin male to male 
cable which cables to the J1 connector of the control card and to the
J1 connector of the PSM cards. The LED's are red for low, and green 
for high.The following are the circuits monitored.

SYNC    ASYNC

FOUR CHANNEL SYNC SIO CARD P/N 430212-001
FRONT PANEL # 4SUS1

     The SYNC card has a male fifty (50) pin connector (J3) for network 
connections and a female fifty (50) pin connector (J1) for monitoring
purposes. This card has four (4) ports available for use in groups of
two (2). It has two (2) switches accessible from the front of the card.
Each switch corresponds to a port group such as channels A-B and C-D. 
Some of the switches have an arrow on them which is used to select the
address you want, others do not have the arrow, but are used to select
the address by positioning the flat part of the knob away from the address
you want to select. The channels you select are also in groups of two (2).
Although only the even numbers are shown, they correspond as follows 0-1, 
2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, A-B, C-D, and E-F. To address the card, you need to 
know what the address is in the tymfile. Once you have that, you just pick 
which channel group you want to use and turn the dial to that address.
The addresses do not have to be in sequence. Below is an example.

CH A,B = ADDR C-D
CH C,D = ADDR 4-5

NOTE: THERE IS ALSO A "OFF" POSITION ON THE SWITCH WHICH IS USED TO
      TURN THAT SPECIFIC PORT GROUP OFF, AS DEEMED BY THE TYMFILE.

     This card also has a clock switch for each port. These are located
towards the middle of the card, two (2) to the top of the resistor network,
and two (2) to the bottom of the resistor network. The configuration
for the clocks are as follows:

                   B   A
   back of card    D   C   front of card

The set up is like a backwards "Z". To turn the clocks "ON", put the switch
in the "DOWN" position. To turn them "OFF" put the switch in the "UP"
position.

EIGHT CHANNEL ASYNC NONSIO CARD P/N 430192-001
FRONT PANEL # 8AUN1

   The ASYNC NONSIO card has a male fifty (50) pin connector (J3) for
network connections and a female fifty (50) pin connector (J1) for
monitoring purposes. This card also has two (2) twenty-six (26) pin
connectors to connect two (2) four (4) port groups to the ASYNC card in
the engine. The port assignments are as follows, The top connector (J2)
is for port groups 0-3 (X3), 8-11 (X5), 16-19 (X7), or 24-27 (X9), the 
bottom connector (J4) is for port groups 4-7 (X4), 12-15 (X6), 20-23 (X8),
or 29-31 (X10). The "X" number equates to the connector on the ASYNC card
in the engine. The ports do not have to be in sequence, but they must
correspond to the ASYNC port group from which you are cabling. Below 
is an example.

ASYNC CARD CONNECTOR "X7" CABLES TO THE "J2" CONNECTOR ON THE PSM
CARD FOR PORTS 16-19.

ASYNC CARD CONNECTOR "X4" CABLES TO THE "J4" CONNECTOR ON THE PSM
CARD FOR PORTS 4-7.

This will give you your eight (8) ASYNC ports 16-19 and 4-7. In most
applications though you will be using continuous port groups such as
0-3 and 4-7. The connectors are keyed, but the red stripe on the
ribbon cable should always be down for conventions sake.

To cable up the connector panel you simply use the fifty (50)
to fifty (50) pin breakout panel cable P/N 160159-TAB and cable
from the PSM cards J3 connector to the appropriate fifty (50)
pin connector on the connector panel. Be sure to tighten down
all screws as they are part of the electrical circuit. There
is currently an EAR being submitted to correct a grounding problem
with the connector panel, so if you must use the connector panel
be sure to get the modification done to the connector panel or
you could run into some problems.

                   INSTALLATION PROCEDURES


          SLIDE RACK MOUNTING INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

1.  From the inside of the cabinet, on the side rack mounting rail,
    measure from the bottom of the rail 7-7/8" up, and mark with a
    white ink pen. Repeat this for each corner of the engine frame.

2.  Set left side mounting bracket so that the oval screw holes on 
    the bracket are in the back of the engine frame.

3.  Mount the bracket so that the bottom edge is at the measured white
    ink marks. Secure the bracket-front with 1-screw just so that it 
    holds it in place while the bracket-back can be secured with 1-screw.

4.  Install the other screw in the bracket-front and do the same for 
    the bracket-back.

5.  Repeat steps one (1) through four (4) for right side mounting bracket.

6.  Verify that the rack mount brackets are exactly horizontal. When
    they are, then tighten the screws.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

      INSTALLATION PROCEDURE TO ATTACH CARD CAGE TO SLIDE RACK         

1.  Fully extent the slide member by pressing the thumb lever to
    disengage the latch. Continue moving the fixed slide until
    the intermediate slide member is completely extended.

2.  Repeat step one (1) for the other slide member.              

3.  Align card cage rails with bracket slide members,           
    then slide card cage into rack.

4.  Insert card cage completely into rack by gripping the corners of  
    the card cage, push in until the slide rails are totally retracted.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

            FLAT BRAID CABLE INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

1.  Remove the four (4) screws on the ground plane of the backplane.

2.  Attach the four (4) flat braid return cables with the replacement 
    screws, (four total) to ground plane. DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN SCREWS 
    INTO BACKPLANE.

****************************** C A U T I O N ******************************

MAKE SURE THAT THE BRAIDED CABLES DON'T TOUCH THE TERMINATOR BOARDS OR
THAT THEY DON'T COME IN CONTACT WITH ANYTHING BUT THE ENGINE'S GROUND 
PLANE. IF YOU FEEL THAT THEY WILL, BEFORE INSTALLING THE GROUNDING STRAP,
ROUND OFF THE CORNERS ON THE ENDS THAT GO TO THE ENGINE'S GROUND PLANE. 
THIS SHOULD REDUCE THE CHANCES OF THEM SHORTING OUT THE ENGINE BACKPLANE.

***************************************************************************

3.  Secure the four (4) flat braid cables to the top of the card cage
    chassis with the screws (four total) that are supplied.

TESTING PROCEDURES FOR THE PSM DAUGHTERBOARDS:

There are two tests we currently use to test the SIO PSM daughterboards,
one is the SLSIO and the other is the SIODIA. The difference is that
the SIODIA lets us test the control signals.

With the use of SLSIO you must use the INTRA-LOOPBACK plugs (P/N 630032-001
through 630032-004) to test the boards. You must also turn on the clocks.

With the use of SIODIA you must use the INTER-LOOPBACK plugs (P/N 630032-005
through 630032-008) to test the boards. You must also set the clocks and use
address eighty (80) on the motherboard.

For testing the NON-SIO PSM daughterboards we currently use the
SYNASY diagnostic. With this diagnostic you must use the INTRA-LOOPBACK
PSM plugs.

For demonstration purposes only we will describe the procedures for
testing a NON-SIO and a SIO PSM SYNC card.

***************************************************************************

TESTING PROCEDURES FOR SYNC UNSWITCHED NON-SIO PSM CARDS

The following test procedure is for testing the four (4) channel
sync unswitched non-sio PSM card (P/N 430193-001) utilizing the
SYNASY diagnostic.

 1. Boot the engine.

 2. Load (engdiag)synasy.nib from system 25, 70, or your Pro-Lite.

 3. Connect one (1) ASC149 cable (red edge to the right) to the
    Sync motherboards first port group (X4). The SYNC board connectors
    are laid out as follows.

 _________________________________________________________________________
|  ____   ________   ____   ________   ________   ____   ________   ____  |
| | X3 | |   X4   | | X5 | |   X6   | |   X7   | | X8 | |   X9   | |X10 | |
| |____| |________| |____| |________| |________| |____| |________| |____| |
|_________________________________________________________________________|

Connectors X3, X5, X8, and X10 deal with clocking and are described below.
Connectors X4, X6, X7, and X9 are the actual ports and are broken down as
follows.

Connector X4 is ports 0-3
Connector X6 is ports 4-7
Connector X7 is ports 8-11
Connector X9 is ports 12-15


 4. Connect 9600 clocks. Clock selection is as follows

     TX CLK  NOT USED  4800                PORT SELECTION
    ___|_____   |_    ___|____ 
   /         \ /  \  /        \  PINS      19/20  17/18  15/16  13/14

   \_________/ \___/ \________/
     RX CLK   NOT USED  9600 
 
The clocks are used when there is no modem clocks or in cases of hardwire
connections. To connect a clock you simply use the sync clock jumper plug
(P/N 630009-001) and connect on connector X3 with the 9600 up. This will
give you a 9600 clock on all ports of connector X3.

 5. Place sync loopback plugs (P/N 630009-001) and 9600 clocks on the 
    remaining ports.

NOTE: P/N 630009-001 contains four (4) sync loopback plugs and four (4)
      sync clock jumper plugs.

NOTE: YOU CAN REMOVE THE ASYNC AND SIO BOARDS IF YOU DESIRE, BUT, IF YOU
      DO LEAVE IN THE ASYNC BOARD YOU MUST PUT THE ASYNC LOOPBACK PLUGS
      (P/N 630010-001) ON ALL PORTS.

 6. Connect the ASC149 cable to the J2 connector on the PSM card with the
    red edge down. The J2 connector is the top connector on the card.

 7. Plug in the PSM SYNC INTRA-LOOPBACK plug (P/N 630032-001) into the J3
    connector of the PSM card.

 8. Plug in the monitor cable into the J1 connector on the PSM card.

 9. Go to the engine console and enter DTA,SET,DTA,A00,ADR,RUN.

NOTE: If the diagnostic was loaded with LOADII, then step nine (9) is
      not need as the program will automatically start executing.

10. Go to the terminal and if you have a prompt (*), type "GO".

NOTE: CTS and RTS LEDs on controller card are high (GREEN LEDs LIT),
      with the "RED" LEDs out on ports zero (0) and one (1), and on,
      on ports two (2) and three (3). All other LEDs are lit.

11. The diagnostic repeats continuously until the machine halts or is
    interrupted by the user (S). While the test is running, the second
    and third leftmost digits on the display console will increment on
    each pass through the diagnostic.

12. Dial through all four (4) ports on the control card to ensure
    that all ports are operational.

13. If all are fine, then go on to the next PSM board or next SYNC
    card connector.

14. To stop the test, just type "S".

15. If you experience any difficulties refer to the tech tips section.

***************************************************************************

TESTING PROCEDURES FOR SYNC (V.24) UNSWITCHED SIO PSM CARDS

The following test procedure is for testing the four (4) channel
SYNC unswitched sio PSM card (P/N 430212-001) utilizing the SIODIA
diagnostic.

 1. Boot the engine.

 2. Load (engdiag)siodia.nib from system 25, 70 or your Pro-Lite.

 3. Remove the multi-function, sync, and all controller cards that can
    generate an interrupt (i.e. any card with a device address except
    async).

 4. Set the address on the PSM cards channels A, B, to zero (0) and
    channels C, D, to off.

 5. Turn the clocks "ON", on the PSM card. (ON = DOWN) 

 6. Plug the PSM SYNC INTER-CHANNEL loopback plug (P/N 630032-005) into 
    the "J3" connector of the PSM SYNC card.

 7. Go to the engine console and enter the following, "DTA", "ADR","DTA",
    "SET", "1400", "ADR", "RUN". This is the data pattern test. 

 8. The engine console should begin incrementing. If an error is detected,
    the engine CPU will halt. For error descriptions refer to SIODIA.DOC.

 9. If no errors were received, then halt the engine CPU, and enter the
    following on the engine console, "DTA", "ADR", "DTA", "SET", "2894",
    "ADR", "RUN".

10. The engine console should be sequencing through the following display:

    0020  0000     RTS PORT 0
    0008  0000     DTR PORT 0
    0000  0020     RTS PORT 1
    0000  0008     DTR PORT 1

    If one or more of the signals are missing the console will not flash
    the digit associated with the missing signal.

11. Go the the PSM control card and you should see the following signals
    cycle through, DSR and CTS, DTR, then RTS. If you observe this, the 
    card passes the control signal test.

12. Remove the PSM loopback plug (P/N 630032-005) and the console should
    be all zeros (0).

13. Now you are ready to test channels C and D by turning channels A and B
    to "OFF", and C and D to zero (0). 

14. If you experience any difficulties refer to the tech tips section.

***************************************************************************

The following test procedure is for testing the four (4) channel SYNC
unswitched sio PSM card (P/N 430212-001) utilizing the SLSIO diagnostic.
When utilizing this test you must use the PSM INTRA-LOOPBACK plug
(P/N 630032-001) on the appropriate PSM card. You must also turn on the
clock associated with the port in test. This diagnostic resides in the
slot and is under control by DDT. It provides a choice of test patterns,
but for our purposes we only use the 2047 test pattern. The following is
an example of how to set up the test.

 1. Once the slot is loaded, log into DDT and attach to the slot.

 2. Upon receiving the asterisk prompt (*), type "?STAT".

 3. The slot will output a command prompt ":>" and is ready to receive
    commands. Below are the valid commands:

    EXIt            log off
    Quit            quit , back to DDT
    Display         display status of test
    Help            print this list
    PATtern         select test pattern to be output
                    1 - 2047 pattern
                    2 - alternating bit pattern
                    3 - user supplied halfword data pattern
    Reset           reset all counts
    SELect          select a logical unit
    STArt           start the test
    STOp            stop the test

 4. After receiving the prompt you must select the test pattern and
    the logical unit you are going to test. For this test we will
    use logical unit zero (0).

 5. To select logical unit zero type "SEL 0", you should now get the 
    confirmation that you have indeed selected the correct logical unit.

 6. Now you must select a test pattern, to do so, type "PAT 1", this will
    select the 2047 test pattern.

 7. Now type "STA", this will start the test.

 8. Now type "D", this will display the test results.

 9. Let the test run for about five (5) minutes, using the "D" command
    off and on the check the progress.

10. If no errors are received then the board is good, if however you
    did receive some errors, you might check your connections and run
    run the test again.

11. Now type "STO", this will stop the test and put you back to the command
    prompt (:>).

12. Now you can either test another logical unit or log off.

13. If you experience any difficulties refer to the tech tips section.

______________________________________________________________________

                 T E C H N I C A L  T I P S

The following are some useful tech tips which may be of some help if
you are experiencing difficulties with the PSM unit.

1. If you plug NON-SIO SW/UNSW SYNC CARDS into slot 1, you will
   lose port 0, as this is used for heartbeat.

2. Start testing in a logical manner,
   A. Engine.
   B. Motherboard (if SIO), SYNC/ASYNC (if NON-SIO).
   C. Ribbon cable, either from Motherboard to Control card, or SYNC/ASYNC
      to NON-SIO PSM card.
   D. PSM power supply.
   E. PSM control card.
   F. PSM card itself utilizing both INTRA/INTER loopback plugs.
   G. Cable from PSM card, is it a port or the whole cable.
   H. Whatever the cable connects to from the PSM card.

3. Make sure the PSM cards are in their proper slots.

4. Make sure that you are using the correct PSM card and cable, and, that
   the PSM cards are addressed correctly and cabled to the correct port.

5. Insure there are no bent pins on the PSM Backplane. If you encounter
   bent pins, power the unit down and try to straighten the pin with a
   set of needle nose pliers. If you are unable to straighten out the 
   pin move the card to another slot on the same SIO bus. If none are 
   available and you have some NON-SIO cards you can move these (the
   NON-SIO) to the other SIO bus. You should then order another PSM 
   Backplane.

6. If you try to Down line load with no Daughterboard with the address
   of zero (0), this will sometimes not work. What you have to do is
   change the Motherboard address to "EIGHT FOX" (8F). Start your load,
   when the load is finished, change the Motherboard address back to
   "EIGHTY" (80), and press the "INI" button. This should bring up the 
   Node.
