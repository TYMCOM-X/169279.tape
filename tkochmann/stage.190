Don:

	With the certain advent of the closure of manufacturing in Irvine I
urgently recommend that at this budget time resources be assigned for an
effort to reestablish a "Staging" environment under NTS.  Ideally Staging
should have been brought under our control before this time as true staging
of customer equipment does NOT occur.  Staging has consistently failed to
procure customer interface code to perform any realistic "staging" of customer
equipment.  They are not positioned well to insist from our clients and CSs
that the field people be held accountable for providing the necessary software
requirements and target codes.  We on the other hand, are quite well
positioned to insist on actual application interfaces as we are already
involved in the establishment of a tracking to completion procedure of new
installs of applications.  We also are well positioned to implement a staging
process for public network equipment which is not performed in the Staging
department as we know it.  With the upcoming surge in public network activity
over the next year with the introduction of Prodigy to the PDN we should be in
a position to ensure that the upcoming modifications to the network come off
with minimal problems.

	Staging equipment under NTS can also be expanded to include an
incoming hardware inspection and test which is mandatory as we receive our
hardware from refurbished sources or ANY newly manufactured sources.  If
we fail to plan for the upcoming changes at this time we, as a company, will
not be well positioned to handle the upcoming variations in hardware
delivery schedules, quantities and qualities.  I would very much like to
take responsibility for this effort.  I would involve most likely John
Schmidt and Stan Richards with the project tasks.  Stan has expressed a
desire not to be assigned to any more field dial-up problems and his T1
project will soon be in the hands of the network engineering and field
groups entirely which will free him up for the effort.  John's primary
task of the Turbo project seems as if it can go either way at this time.
Either it will be graciously put to rest by BT or we will see customers
taking deliveries of it this year.  Should Turbo go away John will be clear
to pursue the staging effort with Stan.  Should Turbo become a product this
year that we see customers taking delivery of, then again John is the logical
candidate to drive the Turbo staging efforts.  We would require a secretary
dedicated to the project and one intermediate level technician to assist
with shipping, receiving, mechanical assemblies and inventory controls both
of which can be procured from temporary agencies.  I have little or no
interest in sustaining any of the exisiting personnel resources from Irvine
for this task.  Should they wish to relocate to here we should evaluate the
benefits quite carefully.  I would be interested in procuring their exisiting
hardware however which includes a SUN server, a Supervisor and a few other
various pieces of hardware which should be accounted for in the budget.  I
am suggesting cutting the STS hardware lab floor space by 50% which can be
accomplished simply by cleaning it up and making a more efficient use of the
hardware within it.  There is a virtually unused software Q.A. office in the
corner of the lab which can be reserved for CSs and customers who track their
equipment through our staging area.

	Product Support can be directly involved with the incoming inspection
and testing of hardware and be immediately aware of issues which need to be
addressed.  A dedicated Q.A. inspection technician should also be procured
for equipment audits which could also be acquired through a temporary agency.
I would like to see this person under the domain of Product Support rather
than Technical Support as it eliminates the intermediate process of NTS
detecting and reporting any problems to Product Support.  Please be reminded
at this time that we in NTS will be assuming a greater role in the CCB
process.  Having Product Support directly involved in the incoming inspection
and Q.A. process of staging is essential.  At this time our manufacturing
people catch and report a myriad of subtle mechanical and electrical problems
which are flagged in the CCB.  These subtle problems could quite easily 
overload the NTS group if Product Support is not involved with our staging 
efforts which will predictably uncover these problems weekly.

	Should this proposal of incorporating staging under our group seem
less than desirable at this time then please consider the resources that we
will ultimately dedicate to perform incoming hardware Q.A., training any
new staging personnel and additional front-line support of hardware installs
as the trade off.  As manufacturing fades out of Irvine we may be able to
save some money this year and procure machines, cables and PCBs at minimal
expense.

	I am taking a more aggressive position in addressing a rather large
number of maleficent issues this year which include everything from product
Q.A. to diagnostics tools to field support to manufacturing support and now
to staging.  I have no interest in company politics beyond possibly lobbying
for resources and support from other organizations nor do I have an interest
in acquiring more power.  I am solely interested in preserving the network
and it's resources.  If this concept of accepting the responsibilites and
risks of staging is not to your liking then perhaps we can redirect the
effort to another organization.  I'm quite certain that we have "enough"
to do without this additional task but I do feel a resposbility to flag
it to you and propose an opportunity to gain more visibilty with BT right
at the start of the 90's.
