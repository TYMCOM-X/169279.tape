                          2 -  GENERAL INFORMATION






                       2.1  Overview of the Bootstrap



    BOOT09  is a  release of  the bootstrap  containing a  subset  of the
    version   9.0  bootstrap   source  code   (BOOT09.SRC)  conditionally
    assembled using the assembly options in "BOOT09.OPT".  The  major new
    features  of  BOOT09  are support  for  downloading  from  HDLC lines
    connected to  the first four  SIO motherboards, including  HDLC lines
    connected to SIO ports whose SIO port numbers are  discontinuous, and
    from SYNC lines connected  to either SYNC board.  BOOT09  retains the
    SYNC  and  HDLC  line  loading  capabilities  of  previous  bootstrap
    releases and contains  the TTY loader that  was removed from  the MXP
    bootstrap (BOOT07) because  of space considerations.  The  tape, 10MB
    disk, and MSC1400  disk loaders that were  also removed from  the MXP
    bootstrap source code have been restored to BOOT09.SRC.

    The code  to support HDLC  lines connected to  motherboards addressed
    above 83x has been removed.  Additionally, since there is  no present
    means of directly loading  multimeg bound files, there is  no support
    of  multimeg  in  the  boot  code.   Multimeg  boot  support  will be
    incorporated into the bootstrap code when it becomes  necessary.  The
    XPI load method  has been disabled in  this version of  the bootstrap
    code.

    VERSION 7.0 OF THE ENGINE  BOOTSTRAP WILL REMAIN THE ONLY  VERSION TO
    SUPPORT THE XPI BOARD.

    The function of the bootstrap is to transfer data from  input devices
    to memory (load)  and from memory  to output devices  (dump).  BOOT09
    allows data to be dumped  from any memory location in an  Engine (the
    maximum  amount of  memory  in a  machine is  one  megabyte).  BOOT09
    allows data to be loaded into any memory location below the relocated
    copy of BOOT09 at location yF000, where "y" is either 7 or  F (BOOT09
    uses the top 1000x bytes of memory).

    BOOT09 is initially copied from PROM into the low RAM  addresses 700-
    FC7x, inclusive.  BOOT09 begins  by determining the amount  of memory
    in  the Engine  by  attempting to  decrement the  contents  of memory
    locations  at  the  end  of successively  lower  64K  blocks  until a
    successful memory access is detected.


    2                                                          BOOT09 DOC
    GENERAL INFORMATION                                 December 20, 1988


    Once  it  determines  the  amount of  memory  in  the  Engine, BOOT09
    relocates itself  into the  top 1000x bytes  of memory.   (NOTE:  The
    relocation routine itself  is not copied  to high RAM.)   BOOT09 then
    performs  non-destructive   writes  to  memory   locations  0-FFFFFx,
    inclusive, regardless  of the actual  amount of memory  present.  The
    non-destructive writes initialize and reset the  semiconductor memory
    error-correcting   circuitry   chip   (ECC).    BOOT09   clears   the
    semiconductor memory  error logs, extinguishing  the amber  (SBE) and
    red (DBE) LEDs on the front edge of the semiconductor memory board.

    BOOT09 resets SIO motherboard device addresses 80-83x, inclusive.

    BOOT09  then  patches  memory  locations  48-6Bx  with  six  RX3 jump
    instructions.  These  jump instructions  are used  to access  the six
    entry points that version  9.0 of the bootstrap source  code (BOOT09)
    provides:


        0048 - Low RAM restoration routine
        004E - MSC1400 disk loader
        0054 - Magnetic tape loader
        005A - SYNC/HDLC line loader
        0060 - TTY port loader
        0066 - Ampex 10 Meg disk loader


    Having completed  its initialization,  BOOT09 executes  the SYNC/HDLC
    line loader.

    Once BOOT09  has relocated itself  to high RAM,  all working  data is
    stored  in the  top 1000x  bytes of  memory.  The  low RAM  area that
    BOOT09 was  originally loaded  into (700-FC7x)  may be  freely loaded
    into.  If an attempt  is made to load data  from a SYNC or  HDLC line
    into  the  top  1000x  bytes of  memory,  BOOT09  will  be restarted.
    Restarting   BOOT09  resets   device  addresses   80-83x,  inclusive,
    terminating the  transmission of  the current  acknowledgement record
    (if it is still being transmitted).  As additional records  that load
    into the bootstrap's  RAM are received,  the console will  display "0
    0000 0009", with  the left-most digit  changing but resetting  to "0"
    constantly.

    NOTE:  Previous releases of the bootstrap did not acknowledge records
    that attempted to load into the high RAM bootstrap area.  To increase
    the speed of the  bootstrap, BOOT09 acknowledges records  before they
    are unpacked  (and an  attempt to  load into  the bootstrap's  RAM is
    discovered).  Resetting the device addresses of all  SIO motherboards
    and reinitializing all enhanced SYNC microcoded line descriptors is a
    reasonable  way  of  destroying  an  acknowledgement  record  that is
    already being transmitted.

    A very simplified flow of the bootstrap operation is as follows:

    4                                                          BOOT09 DOC

    Although any  Engine binary  file that  does not  contain data  to be
    loaded into the top 1000x bytes of RAM may be loaded into  an Engine,
    BOOT09 is primarily used with the following types of activity:


        o  Bound files (including ISIS images and stand-alone code).


        o  Diagnostics (Memory, CPU, MAC, Memory, SIO, etc.).


        o  Dumping core images of machines.




    BOOT09 will work with any of the following configurations:

        o  Core or Semiconductor Memory

        o  MAC I,  MAC II  or  MAC III

        o  CPU I

        o  CPU III (8 MHz  or  10 MHz)




                     2.2  Enhancements to the Bootstrap



    The following enhancements have been made to increase  the usefulness
    of BOOT09:

    1.   BOOT09 supports  downloading over  HDLC lines  connected  to SIO
    ports  on  all  four  SIO  motherboards  (device  addresses  80-83x).
    Previous  versions of  the bootstrap  could only  download  over HDLC
    lines connected to SIO ports on the SIO motherboard at device address
    80x.

    2.  BOOT09 supports downloading through any SIO port connected  to an
    SIO motherboard, regardless of discontinuity in the numbering  of SIO
    ports.  Previous versions of the bootstrap could not download through
    an SIO port unless all lower numbered SIO ports were present.

    3.  BOOT09  will allow  downloads through  SIO or  SYNC ports  in the
    event SIO port  0 is bad or  non-existant.  Previous versions  of the
    boot would not continue to scan SIO or SYNC ports when SIO port 0 was
    bad, in effect eliminating any possible downloads.

    4.  BOOT09  supports downloading  over SYNC  lines connected  to both
    SYNC boards.  Previous versions  of the bootstrap could  not download
    over SYNC lines connected to the second SYNC board.

    5.  BOOT09  contains the  TTY loader  that was  removed from  the MXP
    bootstrap (BOOT07) because of space constraints.

    6.  BOOT09 supports  downloading over HDLC  lines at all  baud rates.
    Previous releases of the bootstrap could not download over HDLC lines
    at less than 4800 baud.

    7.   BOOT09   halts the  target  machine when  a  machine malfunction
    interrupt  occurs.   Previous  releases  of  the  bootstrap  disabled
    machine malfunction interrupts.

    8.  BOOT09 does not assume that SYNC input records will  be separated
    by a minimum of one marking halfword (FFFFx).

    9.  BOOT09 will allow downloads over  V.24 SIO lines when  the clocks
    are provided  internally at speeds  less than 9600  baud and  the N/T
    jumper on multifunction board is configured for high-speed interrupts
    (in the "T" position).  Previous versions of the BOOT code  would not
    allow downloads under these conditions.

    10.  BOOT09  determines the  frequency of C clock  interrupts to
    ensure  the  timing of  bootstrap  routines is  not  affected  by the
    position of  the N/T  jumper on the  multifunction card.   This means
    that the speed of the line scanning on the front console  (left digit
    cycling between 0 and F) will NOT be affected by position of  the N/T
    jumper  on   the  multifunction  card   (high  or  low   speed  async
    interrupts).

    11.  BOOT09 allows 3270  controllers to be connected as  "SYNC lines"
    to SYNC ports during  the downloading process.  Previous  releases of
    the  bootstrap  required  that 3270  controllers  be  disconnected or
    powered-off before downloading  could begin.  Beginning  with version
    9.0 of the Engine bootstrap source code, the downloading line  is not
    selected until a complete, correctly checksummed record  is received.
    Previous releases of the bootstrap selected the downloading line when
    the first  SYNC pattern  (3232x) was  received.  As  3270 controllers
    constantly transmit the IBM  SYNC pattern (which is also  3232x), any
    powered-on 3270 controller was invariably selected as the downloading
    line.

                      2.3  Limitations of the Bootstrap



    The following is  a list of  the preliminary release  limitations for
    BOOT09  as  of  the  initial  release  date.   These  limitations are
    scheduled for correction or inclusion into the BOOT09 code  when time
    permits.  At this time the only restrictions for BOOT09 usage  are as
    follows:

    1.  BOOT09 is  unable to access  any SIO motherboard  addressed above
    83x.

    2.  BOOT09 has no operational XPI interface, therefore it can  NOT be
    used in XPI cluster machines.  Only BOOT07 will support XPI machines.

    3.  When a receive clock  is connected to the sync board  the console
    display of the line scanning (left digit cycling between 0 and F) may
    appear to run  a 1/4 speed (very  slow ... 1-2 seconds  between digit
    changes).   This  is  a  timing  calculation  problem  that  will  be
    corrected  while  BOOT09  is in  limited  preliminary  release.  This
    timing problem does not have any outward effect on  the functionality
    of the bootstrap code and is  not deemed serious at this point  as it
    can be an intermittent occurrence.

    BOOT09 interfaces with the following devices:

         o  SYNC lines

         o  HDLC lines (V.24, V.35 and OCL)

         o  MSC 1400 hard disk

         o  The RS-232 port on the multifunction board (TTY port)

         o  The watchdog timer

         o  The front console

         o  The SemiConductor memory ECC log


    NOTE:  BOOT09 does NOT support the following load devices:

         o  SIO Motherboards addressed between 84x and 90x.

         o  The XPI board.

         o  Multimeg Memory.




                           3.1  Synchronous Lines



    SYNC lines are scanned  looking for a down-line load  header (3232x).
    Once a down-line load header is received from a SYNC line, input data
    from the SYNC line is buffered by the enhanced SYNC microcode.   If a
    complete,  correctly-checksummed record  is received  in  the buffer,
    loading begins  on that line  and all other  SYNC and HDLC  lines are
    ignored.  The format of records is:

                               3.2  HDLC Lines



    The LOADII/download record format for  HDLC is the same as  for SYNC.
    Data from one of  the HDLC lines connected to  an SIO port on  one of
    the four SIO motherboards  (device addresses 80-83x) is  buffered and
    scanned quickly  for a SYNC  pattern (3232x).  If  a SYNC  pattern is
    received, data from the HDLC line is buffered for an  extended period
    of  time  and   checked  continuously  for  a   complete,  correctly-
    checksummed  record.  If  a  record is  received from  an  HDLC line,
    loading  begins on  that line;   all other  SYNC and  HDLC  lines are
    ignored for the  remainder of the  load/dump.  If no  further records
    appear  on  the  selected  line  within  sixty  seconds,  BOOT09 will
    timeout.  This causes BOOT09  to reset, reinitialize the  Engine, and
    resume scanning all SYNC and HDLC lines for input.

    Resets are issued to device addresses 80-90x, inclusive,  when BOOT09
    first starts, before executing  a transfer command, after  a timeout,
    and after an attempt to load into the bootstrap's RAM.




                             3.3  Watchdog Timer



    If the watchdog timer is not reset approximately every two seconds by
    writing to its device  address, the watchdog timer will,  when armed,
    cause BOOT09 to be reloaded from PROM into RAM.

    The bootstrap PROMs (located on the multifunction board  at locations
    7B, 7C and 6B thru 6H) contain, in addition to the bootstrap program,
    a header used by the CPU microcode during the ROM-to-RAM  copy.  This
    eight byte header is NOT copied into RAM:


      ----------------------------------------------------------------
     |       Initial PSW              |         Initial PC            |
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
     | RAM Address To Store First HW  |  RAM Address To Store Last HW |

    DEVICE INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS                     December 20, 1988



    The first  two halfwords of  the header contain  the PSW  and program
    counter to use after  loading BOOT09.  The program counter  was fixed
    at 720x by release 6 of the bootstrap to allow Tymnet II  to relocate
    the  bootstrap from  low RAM  to  high RAM  upon receipt  of  a DLOAD
    command.  All  future releases  of the  bootstrap should  follow this
    standard.  The third halfword  contains the RAM address at  which the
    CPU is to begin placing the bootstrap.  The fourth  halfword contains
    the RAM address at which the CPU will store the last halfword  of the
    bootstrap.  This RAM address is FC6x for BOOT09.




                             3.4  Front Console



    The Engine console  display is updated by  BOOT09 so an  operator may
    more easily monitor bootstrap status.  See Section 4.2 (Front Console
    Display) of this document for a description of these displays.




                     3.5  Semiconductor Memory ECC Chip



    BOOT09 clears the Semiconductor memory Error Checking  and Correction
    (ECC) chip  error log by  referencing device addresses  78-7Fx.  This
    ECC error log contains a record of single bit errors (SBE) and double
    bit errors (DBE) encountered.  The error log data defines  the faulty
    memory chip for SBE's  and the row that  chip is in for  DBE's.  When
    BOOT09 clears the semiconductor memory ECC logic, the green and amber
    LEDs  on the  front  edge of  the  memory board  will  be momentarily
    illuminated,  then extinguished.   The last  SBE and  DBE encountered
    during the reset process will be saved.

    There are two (2) options of the BOOT09 process that are at the users
    discretion:  position of the watchdog timer toggle switch  located on
    the multifunction board and selection of loader type.




                             4.1  Watchdog Timer



    The watchdog timer toggle switch is located on the front edge  of the
    multifunction board.  If  BOOT09 is to  be loaded from  PROM whenever
    BOOT09 stops resetting the watchdog timer, the watchdog  timer should
    be armed  by depressing the  toggle switch DOWN  until it  clicks and
    remains in the lower position.

                        4.3  TTY Port Load Procedure



    There are two (2) different methods of loading through the  TTY async
    port: using a async line connected to the port, or via a PC using the
    TERMITE program.   The async  line method  can very  slow and  is not
    highly recommended.   The PC  load requires the  user to  be familiar
    with the TERMITE program,  which is a diagnostic tool  propriatary to
    TYMNET.   Additional  information  on  the  TERMITE  program  can  be
    obtained by contacting your TYMNET representative or  TYMNET National
    Technical Support (NTS) personnel.




                        4.3.1  Async Y-Cable Loading



    The TTY port  loader allows loading from  an ASYNC line  connected to
    the TTY port on an Engine.  This procedure is more cumbersome  than a
    load over a  SYNC or HDLC  line and is  very slow, since  the loading
    must be done at 1200-baud.

    Loading  through the  TTY  port requires  a terminal,  a  Y-cable P/N
    160041-001 (ASC 192-1), and an ASYNC line (by hardwire or modem) to a
    functioning network node.  Follow the following steps to  connect the
    Y-cable:

    1.  Connect  the Y-cable to  the terminal, to  the ASYNC line  from a
    network node, and to the TTY port on the front of the Engine's multi-
    function board.

    2.  Press the following keys on the Engine console:

        [PSW] [DTA] 0060 [ADR]

    3.  Set  the terminal baud  rate to 1200-baud  and log into  the host
    that contains the NIB FILE you want to download.

    4.  Using the NAD  assembler, read in the  file to be loaded  and get
    the  highest address  to be  loaded.  This  is done  by using  the %F
    command  which  opens the  file  for read-only,  followed  by  the ;G
    command which  get the local  image (reads) from  the file.   The NAD
    assembler  will  display  the range  of  addresses  contained  in the
    NIB/BND file to the terminal.

    5.  At  this point  the range of  data to  be transfered  (starting a
    zero, up to the highest value displayed following the ;G  command) is
    noted via the NAD command "<start>,<end>;8".  This command  tells NAD
    to start displaying the data range specified in octal.

    6.   The  NAD assembler  will  display a  <CR><LF>  on  the terminal.
    Within two seconds  of the line feed  being displayed, press  the RUN
    key on the Engine's console.

    7.  The terminal will display a random sequence of characters and the
    console will display a gradually decreasing value that represents the
    memory  location  into  which data  is  being  downloaded.   When the
    console  display changes  to  "F FFFF  000A", the  download  has been
    successfully completed.

    8.  If the value displayed  on the console remains the same  for more
    than thirty  seconds and is  NOT "F FFFF  000A", repeat the  TTY port
    procedure.



    A sample display of the above would be as follows:

                              4.3.2  PC Loading



    The  transferring  of files  between  the PC  and  the  TYMNET Engine
    involves  connecting  the  PC  directly  to  the  TTY  port  (on  the
    Multifunction board on  full/mini engines) or the  Multifunction port
    on the Micro Engine.  When loading a Micro Engine, a front console is
    also necessary for execution of the NAD file once it is  loaded.  The
    transfer rate from the PC is solely dependent upon the speed selected
    on the   Multifunction Board or  Micro Engine.  The  transfer process
    involves the following steps:


       o  Connecting the PC to the TTY or Multifunction port as follows:

                                                   +---------------+

                                                   +---------------+


       o  Invoking the TERMITE program by typing the following:

             TERMITE DUMB 1 <speed> <color>


       o  Type an ALT-X.


       o  Initializing   the   transfer  process   by   typing   "TTYLOAD
          <pc-filename>" followed by  a carriage return.  This  step will
          direct the user to place the machine in boot and enter the fol-
          lowing on the console:

             [DTA] 60 [ADR] [RUN]

          which will allow  the machine to  receive the file  being sent.
          Following this  a carriage return  is typed  on the PC  and the
          file transfer begins, with the  display on the Engine's console
          cycling through the  addresses received.  When the  transfer is
          complete, the   leftmost 5 digits  on the Engines  console will
          display "F FFFF"  is the transfer was  successful.  If anything
          other  than   "F FFFF"  is  displayed,  the  transfer  must  be
          attempted again.

       o  At this point the object  file just sent is ready  to be execu-
          ted.  The following instructions are entered via the console:

             [DTA] [SET] <start> [ADR] [RUN]

               where
                 <start> = 0A00 is file loaded was a diagnostic file
                 <start> = 0070 if file loaded was a bound file


     
       o  At this point the Engine will begin executing the code.  If the
          code  was a  diagnostic program  the PC  will  now  display the
          diagnostic banner and prompt  indicating the PC is  now  acting
          as a  terminal connected  to the  TTY/Multifunction  port.   If
          the  file was a bound  file, the node will begin the process of

                   4.4  SYNC and HDLC Line Load Procedures



    The SYNC/HDLC line  loader allows loading from  or dumping to  a SYNC
    line connected to either SYNC  board or an HDLC line connected  to an
    SIO  port  on any  SIO  motherboard addressed  between  80x  and 83x.
    Loading/dumping may  take place  at any baud  rate between  1.2KB and
    19.2KB inclusive on sync  or SIO V.24 lines;  up to 64KB on  SIO V.35
    lines;  and  speeds determined  by SIO motherboard  load for  SIO OCL
    line loads.

    NOTE:  Previous  releases of  the bootstrap  could not  download over
    HDLC lines at less than 4800 baud.

    The SYNC/HDLC line loader can be executed in two different ways:

    1.  The SYNC/HDLC line loader jump table entry at location 5A  may be
    used.  To verify  that the jump table  entry has not  been destroyed,
    press the following keys on the front console:


         [PSW] [DTA] [SET] 005A [ADR] [RD]


    the front console display should read


         0 005A 4300

    if the front console display is not correct, then reload  BOOT09 from
    PROM by repeating step 2 (below).

    If the front console display is correct, then press the [RUN]  key on
    the the front  console to start  the bootstrap execution.   The front
    console display should change to:

         y F000 BA5E

    for a few seconds, and then to

         0 0000 0009

    with the left-most digit changing from 0 to F.  At this  point LOADII
    may be used to load or dump via a SYNC line connected to a  SYNC port
    or an HDLC line connected to an SIO port.








    18                                                         BOOT09 DOC
    BOOTSTRAP OPERATION                                 December 20, 1988


    2.   If the  bootstrap cannot  be restarted  using the  first method,
    BOOT09 must be reloaded from PROM.  This is done by the following:


        o  Clear memory of the target machine by pressing the front
           console keys:

               [DTA] [SET] [DTA] 0 [ADR] [DTA] [WRT] [INC] [RPT]

           hold the [RPT] key until the memory address cycles past zero.



        o  Load  the  BOOT  program  by  toggling  boot  switch  on  the 
           Multifunction  board and  wait for the line scanning to begin
           on the front console display.



    If the SYNC/HDLC  line loader does  not receive a  complete correctly
    checksummed  record  for  sixty  seconds,  BOOT09  will  timeout  and
    restart.  BOOT09 will  then begin searching  all SYNC and  HDLC lines
    for a complete, correctly checksummed record.

                   4.5  MSC 1400 Hard Disk Load Procedure






                          4.5.1  Loading Procedures



    The MSC 1400 Disk loader  is designed to interface with the  MSC 1400
    disk controller and the 160/300 mass storage unit (disk  drive).  The
    Disk Initialization Program (DINP) is designed to save the core image
    of the  .BND file to  disk just prior  to code  initialization.  This
    program is commonly used  for supervisor code and  network monitoring
    and control software (TMCS,  ELF, NEM, etc).   The BOOT  code drivers
    for interacting with the MSC disk controller and disk drive  are used
    by  the DINP  program at  load time.   The entire  core image  of the
    target machine can be loaded  from disk at any time by  following the
    below procedures.

    NOTE:  The default load type for BOOT09 is the MSC 1400  (160/300 MB)
    hard disk loader.

    1.  Clear memory of the target machine by pressing the  front console
    keys:

           [DTA] [SET] [DTA] 0 [ADR] [DTA] [WRT] [INC] [RPT]

    hold the [RPT] key until the memory address cycles past zero

    2.   Load  the   BOOT  program  by   toggling  boot  switch   on  the
    Multifunction board and  wait for the line  scanning to begin  on the
    front console display.

    3.  Modify the  parameter block (used by  the MSC 1400  for accessing
    the disk drive) by writing the "READ" instruction into it at location
    FF00A  (further  information  on the  parameter  block  follows these
    instructions).  Execute the BOOT09  MSC 1400 Disk loader  by pressing
    the front console keys:

             [PSW] [DTA] [SET] [DTA] FF00A [ADR] [RD]
             [DTA] [WRT] [RD]  [INC] [DTA]  2000 [WRT] 
             [RD]  [DTA]  004E [ADR] [RUN]

             NOTE:  Since the MSC 1400 hard disk is the default for
                    BOOT09 this step can be reduced to:

             [PSW] [DTA] [SET] [DTA] 004E [ADR] [RUN]




    20                                                         BOOT09 DOC

    when  the  load has  completed  successfully the  front  console will
    display:

             0 C0DE 800E


    4.  Initialize the code by pressing the front console key(s):

                           4.5.2  Parameter Block



    The MSC 1400  Hard Disk parameter block  is used to set  those values
    necessary to perform read or write operations on the disk drive.  The
    BOOT09 code defines  all of the  parameters necessary to  perform the
    disk operation except the  actual controller command: read  (value of
    20)  or write  (value of  14).  The  parameter block  is  outlined as
    follows:


      FF000     +------------------------------------------------+
                |  memory start address (should be even value)   |
      FF004     +------------------------------------------------+
                |  memory  end  address (should be  odd value)   |
      FF008     +------------------------+-----------------------+

                   where    
                     cntrl cmd =   read = 20 or write = 14

                          4.6.1  Loading Procedures



    The  Apmex 10  Meg  disk loader  is  designed to  interface  with the
    ESELCH, 10 Meg disk controller and the Ampex 10 Meg mass storage unit
    (disk drive).  The Disk Initialization Program (DINP) is  designed to
    save the  core image  of the  .BND file  to disk  just prior  to code
    initialization.  This  program is commonly  used for  supervisor code
    and network  monitoring and control  software (TMCS, ELF,  NEM, etc).
    The BOOT  code drivers for  interacting with the  ESELCH, 10  Mb disk
    controller and disk drive are used by the DINP program at  load time.
    The entire core image of  the target machine can be loaded  from disk
    at any time by following the below procedures:

    1.  Clear memory of the target machine by pressing the  front console
    keys:

           [DTA] [SET] [DTA] 0 [ADR] [DTA] [WRT] [INC] [RPT]

    hold the [RPT] key until the memory address cycles past zero.

    2.   Load  the   BOOT  program  by   toggling  boot  switch   on  the
    Multifunction board and  wait for the line  scanning to begin  on the
    front console display.

    3.  Modify the parameter block (used by the ESELCH for  accessing the
    10M disk drive) by writing the "READ" instruction into it at location
    FF00A  (further  information  on the  parameter  block  follows these
    instructions).   Execute  the  BOOT09 Ampex  10  Meg  Disk  loader by
    pressing the front console keys:

             [PSW] [DTA] FF00A [ADR] [RD]
              0130 [WRT] [RD]  
             [DTA]  0066 [ADR] [RUN]

    display:

             0 C0DE 800E


    4.  Initialize the code by pressing the front console key(s):

             [INI]    ---  or  ---    [DTA] [SET] [DTA] 0070 [ADR] [RUN]


    CAUTION:  The Ampex  10 Meg Disk Loader   was the default  loader for
    BOOT06,  so step 3 (above) was reduced to simply [DTA] [SET] [DTA] 66
    [ADR]  [RUN].  This  has been  changed since  the default  loader for
    BOOT09 is the MSC 1400 Hard Disk Loader.




                           4.6.2  Parameter Block



    The Ampex  10 Meg Disk  parameter block is  used to set  those values
    necessary to perform read or write operations on the disk drive.  The
    BOOT09 code defines  all of the  parameters necessary to  perform the
    disk operation except the  actual controller command: read  (value of
    0130) or write (value of  0210).  The parameter block is  outlined as
    follows:


      FF000     +------------------------------------------------+
                |  memory start address (should be even value)   |
      FF004     +------------------------------------------------+

                        4.7  Magnetic Tape Procedures



    The  tape loader  allows the  same opportunity  for quick  loading of
    machines a the  disk loaders,  except the  medium used is  a magnetic
    tape.   The following  procedures  outline those  steps  necessary to
    create a  magnetic tape  image and to  use this  image for  loading a
    machine.




                       4.7.1  Dumping to Magnetic Tape



    1.  Clear memory of the target machine by pressing the  front console
    keys:

           [DTA] [SET] [DTA] 0 [ADR] [DTA] [WRT] [INC] [RPT]

    hold the [RPT] key until the memory address cycles past zero.

    2.   Load  the   BOOT  program  by   toggling  boot  switch   on  the
    Multifunction board and  wait for the line  scanning to begin  on the
    front console display.

    3.  Load the target machine over an SIO or SYNC line with  the LOADII
    program using the "/N" option to prevent code start-up at the  end of
    the load.

    4.  Restore low RAM when the code has finished loading  (as indicated
    by the output of the  LOADII program), by pressing the  front console
    keys:

             [PSW] 0048 [ADR] [RUN]

    when low RAM  has been restored  successfully the front  console will
    display:

             0 0070 5AFE

    5.   Load  the   BOOT  program  by   toggling  boot  switch   on  the
    Multifunction board and  wait for the line  scanning to begin  on the
    front console display.  Restore low RAM, after the line  scanning has
    begun, on the front console by pressing the front console keys:

             [PSW] 0048 [ADR] [RUN]

    when low RAM  has been restored  successfully the front  console will
    display:


    26                                                         BOOT09 DOC

             0 0070 5AFE

    It is necessary to  repeat the restoring of  low RAM for BOOT  9 code
    initialization.

    6.  Modify the parameter block (used by the Magnetic Tape  loader for
    accessing the tape drive) by writing the "WRITE" instruction  into it
    at location FF00A (further information on the parameter block follows
    these  instructions).  Execute  the  BOOT09 Magnetic  Tape  loader by
    pressing the front console keys:

             [PSW] [DTA] [SET] [DTA] FF00A [ADR] [RD]
             2210  [WRT] [RD]  [INC] [DTA] [WRT] [RD]
             0054  [ADR] [RUN]


    when the  dumping has completed  successfully the front  console will
    display:

             0 C0DE 800E

    7.  Initialize the code by pressing the front console key(s):

             [INI]    ---  or  ---    [DTA] [SET] [DTA] 0070 [ADR] [RUN]

    1.  Clear memory of the target machine by pressing the  front console
    keys:

           [DTA] [SET] [DTA] 0 [ADR] [DTA] [WRT] [INC] [RPT]

    hold the [RPT] key until the memory address cycles past zero.

    2.   Load  the   BOOT  program  by   toggling  boot  switch   on  the
    Multifunction board and  wait for the line  scanning to begin  on the
    front console display.  Restore low RAM, after the line  scanning has
    begun, on the front console by pressing the front console keys:

             [PSW] 0048 [ADR] [RUN]

    when low RAM  has been restored  successfully the front  console will
    display:

             0 0070 5AFE

    3.  Modify the parameter block (used by the Magnetic Tape  loader for
    accessing the tape drive)  by writing the "READ" instruction  into it
    at location FF00A (further information on the parameter block follows
    these  instructions).  Execute  the  BOOT09 Magnetic  Tape  loader by
    pressing the front console keys:

             [PSW] [DTA] [SET] [DTA] FF00A [ADR] [RD]
              2130 [WRT] [RD]  [INC] [DTA] [WRT] [RD]

                         4.7.3  Disk Parameter Block



    The Magnetic Tape  Disk parameter block is  used to set  those values
    necessary to perform read or write operations on the tape drive.  The
    BOOT09 code defines  all of the  parameters necessary to  perform the
    tape operation except the  actual controller command: read  (value of
    2130) or write (value of  2210).  The parameter block is  outlined as
    follows:

                   5.1  Checksum for SYNC and HDLC Records



    Two halfword  checksums are  transmitted with  each incoming  SYNC or
    HDLC record.   The first is  a 'vertical' checksum,  the second  is a
    'diagonal' checksum.




                   5.1.1  Algorithm for Vertical Checksums



    The following is the algorithm for computing the vertical checksum

    1.  Load 0 into accumulator.


    2.  Get a halfword of data.


    3.  XOR data with accumulator.


    4.  Repeat steps 2-3 until all data is processed.




                   5.1.2  Algorithm for Diagonal Checksums



    The following is the algorithm for computing the diagonal checksum:


    1.  Load 0 into accumulator.


    2.  Get a halfword of data.

    31                                                         BOOT09 DOC

    3.   Rotate  16-bit accumulator  left  one bit.   The  high-order bit
    becomes the low-order bit.


    4.  XOR data with accumulator.


    5.  Repeat steps 2-4 until all data is processed.


    NOTE:  The diagonal checksum includes the vertical checksum.
