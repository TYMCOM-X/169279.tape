                PART III - OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE
 
 Considering  the results of the employee's overall performance,  select the
 category that best describes the employee's  performance  during  the  past
 performance period.
 
 Due  to the competitive nature of the markets in which the Information Sys-
 tems Group companies compete,  all employees are  expected  to  perform  as
 described below:
 
 CONSISTENTLY MEETS AND AT TIMES EXCEEDS REQUIREMENTS (CM)
 
 Performance consistently meets and at times exceeds requirements and expec-
 tations.    The  employee  has  a  full knowledge of the job duties and ac-
 complishes these duties with demonstrated competence  in  the  interactive,
 administrative and technical aspects of the job.   The employee anticipates
 problems, initiates appropriate action, and obtains assistance when needed.
 Meets the high standards McDonnell Douglas requires of all employees.
 ___________________________________________________________________________
 
 Occasionally,  an employee's performance may differ from the expected  per-
 formance  level  during a given period.   Descriptions for these exceptions
 are listed below.
 
 MEETS MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS (MM)
 
 Performance meets minimum standards.   Competency in all aspects of the job
 has  not  been fully demonstrated.   The employee requires more than normal
 direction for complex or critical tasks.   At times  performance  may  fall
 below the acceptable level, requiring closer than normal supervision.
 
 DOES NOT MEET REQUIREMENTS (DN)
 
 Performance  is  below minimum expectations and standards,  requiring close
 supervision.   The employee should be on a performance improvement plan and
 termination  or reclassification will be considered if the improvement plan
 guidelines are not met.   The employee is not eligible for an increase  and
 will  remain  ineligible until performance is improved.   (This performance
 category is rarely assigned.)
 
 CONSISTENTLY EXCEEDS REQUIREMENTS (CE)
 
 Performance is marked by high quality and quantity of  work  which  exceeds
 expectations and position requirements on a regular basis.   Generally, as-
 signments are highly complex, and independent decisions and workable alter-
 natives can be depended on.   Only extraordinary problems are  referred  to
 management for assistance.
 
 CONSISTENTLY FAR EXCEEDS REQUIREMENTS (CFE)
 
 Performance  is  consistently  well beyond normal performance expectations.
 Judgment,  resourcefulness,  and depth of  knowledge  are  of  the  highest
 quality.  Contributes unique and innovative solutions to even the most dif-
 ficult  problems  and  repeatedly  makes  valuable contributions to the or-
 ganization.  (This performance category is rarely assigned.)
