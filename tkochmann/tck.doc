
          The Throughput Testing Host is a tool used to test the perform-
          ance of a network, or a specific function within a network.  It
          allows the user  to evaluate  the load  capacity and  the effi-
          ciency of data transmission in the network.  It only runs under
          ISIS II on a Tymnet Engine.   Earlier versions of ISIS will not
          support the  Throughput Testing Host.   It is assumed  that any
          user of this  product is familiar with the  TYMNET network, and
          has a working knowledge of  normal and auxiliary circuits, ISIS
          II slots, ports, NAD, and PROBE.

          The Throughput Testing Host can simulate network logins by cre-
          ating normal and  auxiliary circuits, and can  generate data on
          those circuits.  The user has the option of specifying the num-
          ber of circuits built, the  circuit type (auxiliary or normal),
          and the frequency  and quantity of data  transmitted.  The user
          also has control  over the frequency and  format of statistical
          reports generated by the Host.

          The Host may  be used to test the following  products: TYMNET I
          and TYMNET II Node Codes, Stand  Alone Node Code, ISIS II Code,
          TYMSAT Code, Gateway  Code, and TYMCOM Code.   In addition, the
          Host can be configured  to test the accuracy  of data transmis-
          sion and data turn-around time using its "time/trace" feature.

          The Throughput  Testing Host  allows multiple  terminals to  be
          logged in,  but only  one terminal  may issue  commands to  the
          Host.  Commands issued from other terminals are not interpreted
          as commands,  nor are  they echoed.  They  are treated  as test
          data input  to the Host.  The  range of port  numbers available
          for logins  is specified at  system generation.  With  TYMNET I
          Node Code, the highest port number  is usually 63.  With TYMNET
          II Node Code, the highest port number is usually 89.

          The first terminal to log in  is assigned the highest available
          port number,  and is  considered the "boss".   The boss  is the
          only terminal  able to issue commands  that alter the  state of
          the Host,  its ports, or  the test processing  being performed. 
          The boss is also the only terminal that can receive performance
          data from the Host.


          The  following sections  describe the  commands available,  and
          indicate default  values and  permitted value  ranges for  each
          command.  In the command  syntax, uppercase characters indicate
          mandatory  elements of  the command,  and lowercase  characters
          indicate variable or optional elements of the command.

          Where examples are  given, user entries are  shown in lowercase
          characters  and Host  responses in  uppercase characters.   The
          example of  the Help command is  an exception in that  the Host
          response is  not shown  in uppercase.   Actual output  from the
          Host appears in mixed upper and lower case.

          Commands entered incorrectly generate  error responses from the
          Host.  The system parses commands  to check for validity before
          the user types a Carriage  Return.  Execution takes place after
          the Carriage  Return if  the system  detects no  errors.  Error
          messages are discussed in Section 7.0.

          Note: Those familiar  with  versions of the  Throughput Testing
          Host earlier  than Version 13  are advised that  the parameters
          for using the H, L, N, Q,  and R commands have changed signifi-
          cantly.  Please read the sections for these commands closely.

          The general syntax of commands input to the Host is:

               cv,p1,p2

          where c = a single character command name (upper or lower case)
                v = an optional value
               p1 = an optional beginning port number
               p2 = an optional ending port number

          The comma preceding the beginning port number (p1) is mandatory
          if the beginning port number is  to be specified, even if value
          (v) is  omitted. The  comma between  beginning (p1)  and ending
          (p2) port  numbers is mandatory if  two port numbers are  to be
          specified.   Commas  should  not be  input  in  commands  which
          require a value but do not allow port numbers.

          If one  single port  number is  to be  specified, it  should be
          entered in the beginning port number position.  The ending port
          number and  its preceding comma may  be omitted (e.g.,  L,62 or
          C10,60).

          If no port number is specified  in a command which expects one,
          the command  will affect  all active ports.   If only  one port
          number is specified, the command will affect the specified port
          only.


          The circuit building commands, the  build ISIS message command,
          and the report selection command deviate from this syntax.  The
          syntax used  in these  commands is  described in  Sections 3.4,
          4.1, 4.5, and 5.6.

          An error in command syntax or a typographical error may be cor-
          rected by terminating  the command with an Escape  instead of a
          Carriage Return.  Any command terminated with an Escape will be
          ignored.  An  Escape entered  during execution  of the  Help or
          List command will terminate output and return the system to the
          command  level.  An  Escape  entered  during execution  of  the
          Report command will  terminate output for that  interval, but a
          new report will output at the expiration of the next interval.


          Description:  The  Help command  requests a  list of  available
               commands.  If  "v" = 0 or  null, the Host lists  the three
               categories of help summaries  available (general commands,
               circuit building commands, and report selection commands). 
               If "v" = 1, the Host prints  a list of all commands, their
               value ranges, and  a brief description of each.   If "v" =
               2, the Host  prints a description of  the circuit building
               commands and their  required parameters.  If "v"  = 3, the
               Host prints a description of the Report command formats.


          Description:  This  command specifies  the report  interval, in
               "v" seconds, for ports in the range "p1,p2", and activates
               the Report  command, Type 2  for these ports  (see Section
               3.4).  The  report interval will  be set to  the specified
               value for all active  ports if no port  numbers are speci-
               fied.  If  "v" = 0 or  null, the interval is  not changed,
               but the timer clock is restarted.  This enables the report
               function to  include ports which  were activated  after it
               was first  turned on.   The port  range specified,  or all
               active ports  if none are  specified, will be  reported at
               the interval specified in a previously issued command.  If
               no Interval command has been previously issued, 60 seconds
               is assumed.

          Examples:

               I20,62    Set  the  Report  interval to  20  seconds,  and
                         include port 62 only in Report Type 2.

               I         Set all active  ports to report at  therval
                         specified by the last I command (or 60 seconds).


               Description: This field indicates whether  the Trace func-
                    tion is turned on.  The Trace  command turns on trac-
                    ing,  which compares  incoming data  with data  being
                    output by the Host (see  Section 6.1).  It causes any
                    nonmatches  to be  listed  in the  ERR  field of  the
                    Report command, Type  2 (see Section 3.4).   The Time
                    Trace command  not only  traces, but  also times  the
                    round trip  of the data  being sent, which  is listed
                    using the  Report command, Type  5 (see  Sections 3.4
                    and 6.3).  The Time Trace  command does not require a
                    Trace command.  The Output On  command is required to
                    turn output on, or no data  will be sent (see Section
                    5.4).  The  Untrace command is  used to turn  off the
                    checking of  data as it  comes in (see  Section 6.2). 
                    These commands are typically used in conjunction with
                    loopback and permanent connect  I/O procedures.  They
                    are also used  with a second Throughput  Testing Host
                    in loopback mode (see Section 5.4).

                    Host originating the circuit (ORIG = 0).  The Rebuild
                    command  is typically  used in  conjunction with  the
                    Kill command  to initiate  logins, generate  traffic,
                    zap existing ports,  and issue more logins  (see Sec-

               Type Two displays data in the following categories:

               PORT = Port number assigned by the Throughput Host.

               ICPS = Input characters per second  for the current report
                    interval.   This  figure is  initialized  whenever  a
                    report is requested.  Once the  data is reported, the
                    figure is reinitialized, and counting begins again at
                    zero.

               OCPS = Output characters per second for the current report
                    interval.   This  figure is  initialized  whenever  a
                    report is requested.  Once the  data is reported, the
                    figure is reinitialized, and counting begins again at
                    zero.

               ICHAR = Total number of input  characters during the life-
                    time of this port.  This number is cleared and reini-
                    tialized only  when the  circuit is  zapped and  then
                    rebuilt.

               OCHAR = Total number of output characters during the life-
                    time of this port.  This number is cleared and reini-
                    tialized only  when the  circuit is  zapped and  then
                    rebuilt.

               ERR = Number of loopback errors.  These errors will not be
                    checked for  unless the  Trace command,  or the  Time
                    Trace command  is used  (see Sections  6.1 and  6.3). 
                    The  figure is  initialized  when  a new  circuit  is
                    built.

               TRSYNC =  Synchronization factor of  a loopback  or traced
                    line.  If TRSYNC  is "off", either the  loopback con-
                    nection  is  not  yet  complete,  a  data  error  has


          Default value of "nn":  1

          Permitted range  of "nn":  1  - 16.  The  value of "nn"  may be
               less than or equal to total  number of unused ports, up to
               a maximum of 16.

               Note:  If circuits  are to  be built  from one  Throughput
               Testing  Host to  the same  Throughput  Testing Host,  the
               value of "nn" may not be greater  than one half the sum of
               the unused ports.   Under TYMNET I, only  six circuits may
               be built from one Host to itself at one time due to delays
               in the utilization of internal permuter tables.

          Description:   This command  instructs the  Host  to build  the
               specified auxiliary circuits.   The parameters illustrated
               in the command syntax are as follows:

               Field 1 specifies  the number of auxiliary  circuits to be
               built.  Field 1 must be terminated by a Carriage Return.

               Field 2 includes the user's username and the system number
               of the  host to which  circuits are being  built.  Circuit
               speed control characters  may be included in  the username
               string.   If the  circuits  are being  built  to the  most
               recently  specified username  and Host,  the username  and
               system number may be omitted.   Field 2 must be terminated
               by a Carriage Return if it is  to be followed by the login
               string text contained in Field 3.

               Field 3 contains an optional login  string to be transmit-
               ted to the  target host.  Field 3  provides user responses
               expected by the target Host, such as username and password
               entries required  to pass  through a  gateway.  The  login
               string has a maximum length of 63 characters.  It may con-
               tain Carriage Returns or other control characters.


               When creating more than one circuit,  it is sometimes eas-
               ier to create  a single circuit first to be  sure that the
               syntax format,  the  username, and the password  are valid
               on the target host.  Additional circuits may then be built
               by using the format "Ann Carriage Return Control D", where
               "nn" is  the number  of additional  circuits to  be built. 
               The previous username, password, and  login string will be
               used to create "nn" circuits.

               Note:  Currently,  only 16  circuits may  be built  at one
               time.  If  "nn" is  greater than 16,  the system  will try
               unsuccessfully to build the  specified circuits.  Only the
               first 16 will be  built.  The remainder will  cause a mes-
               sage:

                                    gateway host.  The phrase "myname:-
                                    100;passord" is the login string re-
                                    quired to log in to system 100.

               myname:100;password  work, and finally to system 100.
               Control D            Note:  Both "net1" and "net2" are
                                    gateway usernames whose home hosts
                                    are gateway hosts.  The phrase
                                    "myname:100;password" is the login
                                    string required to log in to system

               this Host has originated.  The Rebuild On command utilizes
               the  same  username  and  password  that  were  originally
               issued.  The Rebuild Off command will turn off this option
               for the specified ports (see Section  4.3).  The Quit com-
               mand will turn off this option  for all ports (see Section

               ated  after the  execution  of the  Kill  command will  be
               zapped.  The message "nn Killed"  will be displayed at the
               terminal when the circuits are killed to indicate the port
               number of  each zapped circuit.  If  "v" = 0 or  null, the
               circuits will not  be zapped automatically.  They  will be
               maintained indefinitely, or until  an explicit Zap command
               is issued (see Section 4.7).

               less than  or equal to the  total number of  unused ports. 
               The maximum number of possible ports  is equal to the num-
               ber of ports  specified in the Tymfile minus  one (NPORT -
               1) (see  Section 8.3).   Note that if  circuits are  to be

               Field 2 includes the user's username,  and the system num-
               ber and password  of the Host to which  circuits are being
               built.  Circuit  speed control characters may  be included
               in the username  string.  If the circuits  are being built
               to the most recently specified host, the username and sys-
               tem number may be omitted.  Field  2 must be terminated by
               a Carriage  Return if it  is to  be followed by  the login
               string text contained in Field 3.

               Field 3 contains an optional login  string to be transmit-
               ted to the  target host.  Field 3  provides user responses
               expected by the target host, such as username and password
               entries required  to pass  through a  gateway.  The  login
               string has a maximum length of 63 characters.  It may con-
               tain Carriage Returns or other control characters.

               Note: The entire command sequence  must be terminated by a
               Control D.


               When creating more than one circuit,  it is sometimes eas-
               ier to create  a single circuit first to be  sure that the
               command syntax, and the username and password are valid on
               an active host.  Additional circuits  may then be built by
               using the  format "Mnn Carriage  Return Control  D", where
               "nn" is  the number  of additional  circuits to  be built. 
               The previous username, password, and  login string will be
               used to create "nn" circuits.

          Examples:

               M                   Build one normal circuit to system 10.
               myname:10;password  Note:  The phrase "myname:10;password"
               Control D           is the login string required to log in
                                   to system 10.

               M3                  Build three Normal circuits to system
               myname:10;password  10, and transmit the letter "Z" with a
               Z                   Carriage Return.  The phrase "myname:-
               Control D           10;password" is the login string re-
                                   quired to log in to system 10.
                                   Note that if system 10 is a Throughput
                                   Testing Host, and one of the circuits
                                   is built to the boss port, the "Z"
                                   being transmitted will be interpreted
                                   as a Zap command.  All circuits will
                                   be zapped.


               Note: In order  to zap the boss port only  and leave other

          Description:   For ports  in the  range  "p1,p2", this  command
               turns off output of test  data previously initiated by the
               Output On  command or by  the Automatic Output  On command
               (see Sections 5.4 and 5.5).  It  also turns off the Report
               command and the  Trace command for ports  in the specified
               range (see Sections 3.4 and 6.1).   If "v" = 1, the totals
               for the ICHAR, OCHAR, and ERR  in the Report command, Type


          Description:  If "v" = 0 or 1,  this command turns on output of
               data for any circuit in the  range "p1, p2" Data length is
               determined by the current burst  rate, and transmission is
               determined by  the CPS rate  specified for each  port (see
               Sections 5.1 and 5.2).  The Host will transmit "B" charac-
               ters at a  time at a maximum of "C"  characters per second
               through the specified ports.

               If "v"  = 0,  the data  pattern transmitted  will be  "XYZ
               0123456789".  If  "v" =  1, the  data pattern  transmitted
               will be "nnn 0123456789", where  "nnn" is the sending port
               number.

               If "v"  = 2, the command  creates a loopback  condition by
               turning off the  output of data patterns,  and causing the
               port to echo all data input to it.  The loopback condition
               may be preserved by use of the Automatic Output On command
               (see Section 5.5).  The tracing  option is also turned off
               for the specified port(s) (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2).

          Description:  This command enables automatic  output of data on
               any circuit built from a port  in the range "p1,p2".  Data
               length is specified  by the current burst  rate, and speed
               of transmission by the current  CPS rate (see Sections 5.1
               and  5.2).  The  Host will  transmit a  data pattern  (XYZ
               0123456789, for  example) "B"  characters at  a time  at a
               maximum  of "C"  characters per  second  to the  specified
               port(s).   Output  data  patterns are  sent  to  specified
               active ports without user intervention.  The loopback con-
               dition established with the Output  On command may be used
               in conjunction  with the  Automatic Output  On command  to
               create an automatic loopback condition (see Section 5.4).

               messages with the  Send ISIS Message command  (see Section
               5.8).  If  "v" =  0, the  command will  clear the  message
               buffer and disable the Send ISIS Message command (see Sec-
               tion 5.8).   If "v"  = 1, the  buffer will  accept another
               line (or  lines) of input.  The  input string will  be the
               hex representation of the message to be sent.  The charac-
               ters 0-9 and A-F are the  only characters accepted by this
               command.  The  alphabetic characters A-F  may be  input in
               upper or lower  case.  A message can have a  maximum of 32
               bytes.  The  first byte  (two hex  digits) represents  the
               message type.  See  the ISIS II documentation  for message
               type definitions.   Only message types 1-9D  are permitted
               unless the Host is configured otherwise (see Section 8.3). 
               Spaces and Carriage  Returns are ignored, and  may be used
               to  format large  message strings.   An invalid  character
               will terminate  the action  of the  command and  clear the
               message buffer.  Input is terminated by entering a Control
               D.  If "v" = 2, the current contents of the buffer will be
               displayed to the boss port in hex.

          Example:

               p1            Enter message in buffer.
               03c1c2c3      Message (hex equivalent to ABC).
               p2            Display message contained in buffer.
               03c1c2c3      Message displayed.
               p0            Clear message from buffer.

          This  section describes  the error  messages  generated by  the
          Host, the meaning, and the probable cause of each message.

          ? (H FOR HELP)

               This is a general error message generated when the initial
               login string is too long, when  there is a syntax error in
               the command string, or when  there are too many parameters
               in the command string.   It is also generated  when nonnu-
               meric input is entered in the v, p1, or p2 field of a com-
               mand.

          COMMAND NOT RECOGNIZED

               This message is  output when an invalid  command character
               is entered (e.g., G, J, Y, or a nonalphabetic character).

          A VALUE WAS GIVEN, BUT NOT EXPECTED, PLEASE RETRY

               This message is output when  the Host encounters a command
               containing a value "v" where no  value is permitted.  Com-
               mands that do not permit a specified value are D, E, F, O,
               Q, T, U, W, and Z.

               Typically, this error message occurs  because the user has
               omitted the comma  preceding the first port  number speci-
               fied.

          PORT# OR PARAMETER OUT OF RANGE

               This message is output when the user specifies a port num-
               ber greater than the possible  maximum, or a value outside
               the permitted range.  This error  message might also occur
               if the comma preceding the first specified port number has
               been omitted.

          ESCAPE DETECTED

               This message is output  when the Host acknowledges  a com-
               mand or  output of  data terminated  with an  Escape.  The
               command will be ignored by the Host.

          LOOPBACK ERROR:  PORT: nnn   EXPECTED: xx   RECEIVED: yy

               This  message is  output when  the Trace  function of  the
               Throughput Testing Host has  detected a transmission error
               on port "nnn".   "Expected" is the field  sent. "Received"
               is the field  received.  The values of "xx""  and "yy" are
               in hex.

          TOO MANY CIRCUITS

               This response is output when all of the circuits allocated
               to the Host  are in  use, and the  user requests  an addi-
               tional circuit using the Auxiliary  Circuit command or the
               Make Normal  Circuit command (see  Sections 4.1  and 4.5). 
               The user may change the NPORT parameter in the Tymfile, or
               enter the Zap command to zap some of the existing circuits
               (see Sections 4.7 and 8.3).

          ISIS UNABLE TO COMPLETE REQUEST

               This message is output  when the  user tries to build more
               circuits in a given slot than ISIS will permit.  Reconfig-
               uring the node  for more circuits, or zapping  some of the
               existing circuits should  correct the problem.   This mes-
               sage is also  output when the slot being used  to build an
               auxiliary circuit  does not  have Aux-Circuit  status.  It
               will also print if  the TYMNET I Node Code is  in the pro-
               cess of zapping  an old circuit, and it  has suspended the
               use of the  remaining free ports.  Wait a  few seconds and
               try again  to see if  this is  the case.  The  user should
               call a network representative if the output of the message
               persists.

          NO DATA FOR MESSAGE

               This message is output when the Build ISIS Message command
               with "v"  set to two or  the Send ISIS Message  command is
               used, and there  is no data present in  the message buffer
               (see Sections 5.6 and 5.8).

          NON-TEXT MESSAGES NOT ALLOWED

               This message is output when an attempt is made to generate
               a nontext ISIS message  using the Build ISIS  Message com-
               mand with "v"  set to one (see Section 5.6).   The Host is
               protected against such action.

          This section describes the tools and methods required to gener-
          ate a Throughput Testing Host.

          One host  number per  Throughput Testing  Host is  typical, but
          multiple host  numbers may be used  as target host  numbers for
          testing purposes.  Multiple  host numbers in a  slot permit the
          user to build  circuits to the Throughput  Testing Host without
          having the  first port arbitrarily  become the boss  port.  The
          first (and  highest) port to log  in to the lowest  host number
          will become the  boss port.  Note that "host  number" refers to
          the network  address used  to communicate with  a process  or a
          portion of a process in an ISIS slot.

          Each host number will be  assigned a consecutive logical number
          starting with zero.  The data pattern for each host number will
          begin with the  logical number assigned to it  (e.g., the first
          host number  will have  a data  pattern 0123456789,  the second
          will have a data pattern 123456789:).


          To generate a Throughput Testing Host, proceed as follows:

          1)   Verify that the files listed in Section 8.2 exist.

          2)   Run NAD  (e.g., R NAD).

          3)   Execute the command file  (e.g., ;X TPUT1.CMD).

          4)   The command  file will  request a  host number.   Type the
               host number and Control D.  (Do not type a Carriage Return
               after the host number.)

          5)   Wait for NAD to finish assembling  (e.g., it will print LO
               BID).

          6)   Create  an auxiliary  circuit to  the Kernel  of the  node
               being loaded.

          7)   Once the slot has been established, load the slot by exec-
               uting the  TPUT1.LSG (Throughput  Host Load  Slot and  Go)
               command file (see Section 8.5).

          8)   Log off the NAD to DDT circuit by typing Control Z twice.

          9)   Exit NAD by typing %Q.

          The Throughput Testing Host may be used to test new or recently
          modified network  products.  All  tests involving  the building
          and zapping of circuits will test the Supervisor.  The Host may
          also be used for the extraction of network performance data.

          Note that using the  Throughput Testing Host can  and will sig-
          nificantly degrade the performance  of the network(s) involved. 
          If  all products  are  performing  properly, the  network  will
          recover at the conclusion of these tests.

          A brief  description of the  typical configuration  for testing
          each of these applications follows.  Keep in mind that they are
          very likely to  change, depending on the portion  of code being
          tested.

          To set up  a test for Stand  Alone Node Code,  proceed  as fol-
          lows:

          1)   Assemble and load  two  Throughput Testing Hosts  on oppo-
               site sides of the machine containing the code.

          2)   Shut a  sufficient number of  lines to guarantee  that all
               circuits  between the  Hosts must  pass  through the  node
               being tested.  (Use PROBE to do this.)

          To test the the  ability of the Stand Alone Node  to handle new
          circuits being built, proceed as follows:

          1)   Establish a number of circuits from  one Host to the other
               using the  Auxiliary Circuit  command or  the Make  Normal
               Circuit command (see Sections 4.1 and 4.5).

          2)   Set those circuits  to be rebuilt automatically  using the
               Rebuild command (see Section 4.2).

          3)   Set new circuits to have a limited lifetime using the Kill
               command (see Section 4.4).

          4)   Zap all ports except the boss (e.g., Z,1,62).  These ports
               will be rebuilt automatically.

          5)   After the period specified with  the Kill command (K), the
               originating Host  will report  those circuits  as "Killed"
               (see Section 4.4).  The  message "nn Killed" will  be dis-
               played to  indicate the  port number  "nn" of  the circuit

               being killed.  At about the  same time, the receiving Host
               will  report those  ports as  "Zapped".   The message  "nn
               Zapped" will be displayed to indicate the port number "nn"
               of the  circuit being zapped.   The circuits will  then be
               rebuilt by the originating Host and reported by both Hosts
               (as nn Port, nn Aux Port, or nn Normal Port).

          Note that all of the above commands should be given by only one
          Host.

          To test the ability  of a new version of Stand  Alone Node Code
          to handle data in high volumes:

          1)   Establish a number of circuits from one Host to the other.

          2)   Turn on the output  at both ends using the  Output On com-
               mand (see Section 5.4).

          3)   Monitor the number of characters  making their way through
               the circuit(s) using  the Interval command and  the Report
               command (see Sections 3.2 and 3.4).

          Throughput Testing Host  runs under ISIS II.  To  test ISIS II,
          proceed as follows:

          1)   Load one Throughput Testing Host.

          2)   Build circuits from one Host to itself.

          3)   Send data along these circuits.

          To test the ability of ISIS II to  build and zap circuits, turn
          rebuild on using  the D command (see Section  4.2), and proceed
          as in Section 9.1, above.

          More complex testing of ISIS II requires additional Hosts simi-
          lar to tests for Stand Alone Node Code, above.

          Testing the Gateway Code requires at least two Throughput Test-

          ceed as follows:

          1)   Load one Host in each network.

          2)   Make sure only one Gateway connects the two networks.

          3)   Establish a set of circuits between one Host and the other
               using the   Auxiliary command or  the Make  Normal Circuit
               command, with the optional login string included (see Sec-
               tions 4.1 and 4.5).  Build an  equal number of circuits in
               each direction.

          4)   Use the  Output On command  to test for  data transmission
               through the gateway (see Section  5.4).  Monitor both ends
               using the  Interval command  and the  Report command  (see
               Sections 3.2 and 3.4).

          5)   Use the Kill  command and the Rebuild command  to test the
               Gateway for  its handling  of a  large number  of circuits
               (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).  Monitor  both ends by observ-
               ing the  "nn port" and  "nn zapped" messages  displayed at
               the terminals connected to each Host.

          6)   To quit, use the Q command at both ends (see Section 4.6). 
               This will also turn off all rebuilds.

          To perform loopback testing of TYMSAT code, execute the follow-
          ing instructions:

          1)   Check the  staus of PCNDSW  in the TYMSAT  node's Tymfile. 
               It should be turned on (set to 1).

          2)   Assuming the node in question is running the correct code,
               crash the node  and bring it up.  This is  done to "clear"
               any permanent circuits that  may exist.  It is  not neces-
               sary if there is a free port.  If the code is not correct,
               regenerate the node.

          3)   Log into the Throughput Testing Host to set up a boss ter-
               minal.  The terminal does not have  to be connected to the
               node that was just brought up.

          4)   Connect a terminal to the node  using a hardwired port and
               log in to the Throughput Testing Host.

          5)   Verify a  successful login  connection by  outputting data
               from the  boss terminal  to the port.   Any values  may be
               used, but the following are recommended.

               B5   Burst Rate = 5
               C5   CPS Output = 5

               received at the terminal attached directly to the node.

          6)   Create the loopback.  Disconnect the terminal and tie pins
               2 and  3 of the node  interface cable (male  end) together
               with a jumper wire.

          cuit built  to the Host  will be  assigned to the  highest port
          number, and considered the new boss  (whether it was built by a
          user at  a terminal, built from  another Host, or  rebuilt from
          this Host).  If a circuit from another Host sends characters to
          the new port, the  Host will attempt to interpret  them as com-
          mands.  The  characters, and the  Host's error  responses, will
          increment the count of input/output characters.

          Similarly, if one port is set for automatic rebuild using the D
          command and the user zaps that port,  it will be rebuilt out of
          the boss port (typically port 63) (see Section 4.2).  This will
          result  in a  "stuck system".   The fastest  and most  reliable
          method of regaining  control of this Host  is to log in  to the
          ISIS II Kernel Host, and to halt  and execute the slot that the
          Throughput Host is  in by using DDT.  This will  cause the slot
          to drop all its circuits and  reinitialize the Host.  To accom-
          plish this, the user needs "Good-Guy" status for that node.

          The character output algorithm controls the rate of output from
          the boss to  all subsequently logged  in terminals.   The algo-
          rithm is  controlled by three  commands:  Burst Rate,  CPS, and
          Speed (see Sections 5.1, 5.2, and 5.7).  It attempts to produce
          an evenly distributed output for defined B, C, and S values, as
          follows:

          1)   It calculates the elapsed time  within the current minute,
               and calculates the  number of characters that  should have
               been output in that time span.

          2)   If the program is behind at  this clock tick, it outputs a
               burst of characters defined by the Burst command (see Sec-
               tion 5.1).   This is  repeated for  each terminal  on each
               background execution cycle.  Only one  burst is output per
               cycle.

          3)   At the beginning of a one minute interval, the output rate
               of the  previous interval is  checked against  the optimum
               output rate.  The program will attempt  to catch up to the
               optimum output rate  unless it is behind by  more than can
               be made up in one mnute plus one second (maximum CPM minus
               desired CPM plus 1 second of  character output).  If it is
               behind by  more than the above  criteria, it will  set the
               port "not behind", and will not try to catch up.

          To build  auxiliary circuits,  the slot  must have  Aux-Circuit
          status.   Otherwise,  the  message  "ISIS  UNABLE  TO  COMPLETE
          REQUEST" will print (see Section 7.0).

          A maximum of 90 ports and 16 Hosts may be specified in the Tym-
          file under TYMNET II Node Code.   Note, however, that a maximum
          of only 64 ports  and one Host may be specified  in the Tymfile
          under TYMNET I Node Code.
