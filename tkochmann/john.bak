     Your Sydney, Australia office does seem to need these same specifcations
also.  In fact, when they discovered we were planning to use your supplies,
they approached our office for documents!

     Perhaps it would be most appropriate if you were to send the "propietary"
documents internally to your own office in Sydney and permit them to handle
the registration of your equipment in Australia.

Thanks in advance;
