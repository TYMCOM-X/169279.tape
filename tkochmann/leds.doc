This document describes the  LEDs found on the Engine boards.  Each
board containing an LED is diagrammed with the approximate position
of the LED looking at the edge of the board as it is mounted in the
chassis (frontal  view),  except  the  Micro-engine I/O board which
is a top view.

   LED 1 (Red) - Repeat  indicator.  Located at switch 1 (SW1) this
     LED  is illuminated  when the repeat (RPT) key on the  console
     is pressed.   This LED is not illuminated during normal usage.

   LED 2 (Red) - Test  clock  indicator.  Located at switch 4 (SW4)
     this LED indicates whether the master clock is being driven by
     the  32 Mhz  crystal or the  Test Oscillator.   If the 32  Mhz
     crystal is driving the clock this LED will not be illuminated.
     If the Test  Oscillator is  driving the clock this LED will be
     illuminated.   Under  normal  usage  this  LED  will   not  be
     illuminated.

   LED 1 (Red) - Microcode  branch  indicator.   This LED  will  be
     illuminated  when   the  microcode   is  executing   a  branch 
     instruction.   Under  normal conditions  this LED will  always
     be illuminated indicating the microcode is running.

   LED 2 (Red) - Microcode parity  error indicator.   This LED will
     be  illuminated  with  a  very  low  intensity  during  normal 
     operation.   This  LED  will be  illuminated  with a very high
     intensity  if  the  microcode  parity  checker  finds an  even
     parity when checking the 64 bit microcode word.
     
   NOTE:  On newer ROM & I/O boards, the low intensitiy of the LEDs
          is considerably brighter than the older boards.  To check
	  the  high  intensity  brightness,  press  the  initialize
	  (INI) button  on the front console.



MULTIFUNCTION

   |                              3   2   1                   |

   LED 1 (Red) - Terminal  interface at  110 baud indicator.   This 
     LED  will be  illuminated if the terminal interface (TTY port) 
     speed indicator is set to 110 baud.  If the terminal interface 
     is any other speed this LED will not be illuminated.

   LED 2 (Red) - SYSCLR0   Signal  indicator.   This  LED  will  be 
     illuminated when the watchdog timer is momentarily  placed  in
     up position, or by pushing the initialize (INI) button on  the
     front console.  During  normal operation  this LED will not be
     illuminated.

   LED 3 (Red) - Power  failure  indicator.   This  LED   will   be 
     illuminated  if  voltages  (+5v DC) should drop  below  preset
     values,  the watchdog timer  does not  receive a  signal  from
     the CPU  within  2.1  seconds  or  the boot switch  is pressed
     up momentarily.  This  LED  will not be illuminated if none of
     the above occurs.






SEMI CONDUCTOR MEMORY

   LED 1 (Red) - Double  bit  error indicator.   This  LED will  be 
     illuminated when a  parity error occurs from a previous memory
     write cycle or a  multiple  bit error  is found.   Double  bit
     errors (DBE)  are not  correctable by the Error Detection  and
     Control logic.

   LED 2 (Yellow) - Single bit error indicator.   This LED will  be
     illuminated when a memory read  cycle results  in a single bit
     error.  Single bit  errors (SBE) are correctable by the  Error
     Detection and Control logic.



SIO MOTHERBOARD

   |                                                   1      |
   |                                                  |_|     |
   |__________________________________________________________|


   LED 1 (Red) - Microcode parity error.  This LED will be illumin-
     ated  during  normal  operation with  a  very  low  intensity.  
     Should a   microcode parity error be detected this LED will be
     illuminated  with a very high intensity.   If this LED is  not
     illuminated the microcode has halted.
     
   NOTE:  On newer  SIO  boards,  the  low intensitiy  of the  LEDs
          is considerably brighter than the older boards.  To check
	  the  high  intensity  brightness,  press  the  initialize
	  (INI) button  on the front console.




MSC DISK CONTROLLER

   |                                       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8    |
   |                                      |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|   |
   |__________________________________________________________|


   The LEDs on the MSC 1400 disk controller are arranged to display
   two hex digits of status.  LEDs  1-4  represent the first  digit
   in hex, while LEDS 5-8  represent  the  second   digit  in  hex.
   The hex values for  each digit  are  represented  with the  most
   significant  bit on the left  and the  least significant  bit on
   the right (i.e.: LED1=8, LED2=4, LED3=2, LED4=1, LED5=8, LED6=4,
   LED7=2, LED8=1)

   The status values are interpreted as follows:
   
        80 - normal operation
        10 - bad pulse from retry routine
        11 - not in core-based FIFO mode (DOB routine)
        12 - data out issued, but pointer is null (DOB routine)
        13 - wrong strap setting (drive type)
        14 - DMA time out
        15 - read word freeze (from RDWORD routine)
        16 - waiting for done to clear
        17 - waiting for done to clear after error
        18 - read in progress
        19 - write in progress
        1A - write word freeze (from WRWORD routine)
        1B - non-existent memory address






XPI MOTHERBOARD

   |                                1   2                     |
   |                               |_| |_|                    |
   |__________________________________________________________|


   LED 1 (Red) - Halt  indicator.   This  LED  will  be illuminated 
     during  normal  operation  indicating  the   XPI processor  is 
     running normally.   Should the XPI  processor encounter a halt  
     condition,  this LED will NOT be illuminated.

   LED 2 (Green) - Reset   indicator.    This  LED  will   not   be 
     illuminated  during normal operation.   If the RESET button on
     the XPI motherboard is pushed, this LED will  be  illuminated, 
     indicating processor has been reset.








E-BUS 

   |                                1   2                     |
   |                               |_| |_|                    |
   |__________________________________________________________|


   LED 1 (Red) - Halt  indicator.   This  LED  will  be illuminated 
     during  normal operation  indicating  the  E-BUS processor  is 
     running  normally.    Should  the  E-BUS  processor  encounter
     a halt condition,  this LED will NOT be illuminated.

   LED 2 (Green) - Reset   indicator.    This  LED  will   NOT   be 
     illuminated  during normal operation.   If the RESET button on 
     the  E-BUS   is  pushed,    this  LED  will   be  illuminated,
     indicating the  processor has been reset.
