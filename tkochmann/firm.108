-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don:

	A variety of modifications have been made to the PICO 1.7 Firmware
addressing some of the old firmware constraints we documented when this
version was released as well as a couple of new bugs.  The changes are:

  I.	Tymsync and Mailbox Interrupt Priorities raised to level 6 for
	the 68010.  ATN1 interrupts were being lost in the Tymsync mode
	at the mailbox level leaving the associated channel in a TX-ENDING
	state until a board reset clears it.

 II.	The RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR control signal bit array reversed in the
	Tymsync mode only for ISIS.  The MSB to LSB order of bits for the
	bit array was set up for the 68010 and not reordered for the
	Engine.  HDLC and Async modes are proper and unchanged.

III.	Oversize records greater than the specified packet length, typically
	1/8th the receive buffer size are now thrown away at the firmware
	level.  All protocols will no longer "see" the oversize records
	written into slot memory areas.

 IV.	Async flow control changed to "X-OFF" at the firmware level on
	receipt of 13x when DC3/DC1 flow-control is enabled as well as
	pass the 13x onto the ISIS slot to handle.  All subsequent bytes
	received will be passed on except for 11x which will release the
	"X-OFF" condition.  Previously neither 13x or 11x was passed on.
