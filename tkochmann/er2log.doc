THE LOG RECORD IS  3 32 BIT WORDS.  THE  FIRST WORD HAS THE  TYPE NUMBER
"ORED" WITH THE SUPERVISOR'S  NUMBER.  THE INTERPRETATION OF  THE SECOND
AND THIRD WORDS ARE DETERMINED BY THE TYPE NUMBER.

THE LIST BELOW  IS ORDERED BY  TYPE NUMBER.  THE  TYPE NUMBER IS  IN HEX
FOLLOWED BY THE NAME OF THE TYPE AND THE CONTENTS OF THE NEXT  TWO WORDS
SEPARATED BY A  ";".  IF THE  WORD'S CONTENTS ARE  TO BE TREATED  AS TWO
HALF WORDS THEN ARE SEPERATED BY  A ",".  IF THE CONTENTS OF A  1/2 WORD
ARE TREATED AS TWO BYTES, THEY ARE SEPARATED BY A "-".
