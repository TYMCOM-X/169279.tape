	The PICO and the Micro IV handle I/O of commensurate loads.
You will find that given a more CPU intensive application such as
the X.25 access types, the PICO has greater processing capability.

	The HDLC Micro IV will perform sync emulation more
efficiently than will the PICO!  There is a loading table in my
document available on (NTS:33)PICO.DOC wherre I define the
performance characteristics of a PICO.  Reference my document
on the Micro IV on (NTS:33)HDLC.DOC and you will observe
some early load test results of the Micro IV.  I suspect that
I should translate these to a load table as for the PICO also.

	Please read the sections on performance and Ontyme or
call me at 408/922-7493 for clarification as required.  I am
currently constructing acceptance test procedures which I know
we will have difficulties with because these machines where
"oversold" to a customer.  I would much prefer to help you get
a realistic idea of our equipment performance before you 
design your network!

Best regards;
