	After spending some time with Bruce Shepherd the last couple of days
I believe we have been able to construct some sort of summary of our support
role as relates specifically to Laurie Hughes.

	Bruce first became aware of Laurie in the London, U.K. office when
he dispatched to support Hywell Morgan with direct on-site fault isolation
of a particularly stubborn SDLC-PICO problem experienced by L.E.B.  Laurie
at that time was involved with TSI and gave every impression to Bruce of
being Tymnet literate and competent.  Bruce was to focus on the PICO product
but as usually is the case, became quite popular around the office with his
Tymnet expertise and helpful manner for a wide range of issues.  To what
extent he and Laurie interacted I can not say but later when Laurie was to
turn up on the BSF project he was fully aware of the value of having Bruce
available as a reference guide.

	For the last few months I myself have received a few calls from
Laurie mainly concerning general configuration issues at the network level.
It was immediately apparent that some of what Laurie was to construct for
the bank was going to require a fair amount of research and detail work.
Several of his calls concerning a possible LAN to WAN connect via X.25
addressed specific details of circuit monitoring abilities in the network
and the collection of accounting data per individual circuits.  Much of what
he queried seemed most properly performed on the LAN side of the connect
so I redirected him towards STS and Stan Richards of our group who performs
Q.A. of P.C. LAN X.25 interfaces to Tymnet.  As Stan never noted calls
from Laurie I presume he found satisfaction in the STS area.

	The PICO and it's proper usage was discussed several times with
Laurie and we did engage the topic of byte sync applications on PICO which
I have always vehemently discouraged.  Byte sync protocols on PICO have
been most troublesome over the past two years and as the box is ideally
suited to xDLC type protocols (bit oriented) I reenforced that installing
the box for byte sync is not a proper utilization of PICO.  During some of
the early calls we also discussed in generalities the collection of code
patches required with various software interfaces installed on PICO as I
wanted to be certain he was fully aware of the fundmentals of the box.  I
felt it quite important to emphasize the differences of PICO vs Engine
installations when I did have opportunity to talk to Laurie.  PICO is a
rather radical deviation from conventional Tymnet architecture with an
added degree of complexity as it is one of the first Tymnet products that
affords the opportunity to control the serial control devices via software
which must be reflected with proper hardware options.

	As the BSF network is to be a secure isolated system I did in
fact offer Laurie the invitation to contact either myself or any of my
staff as needed for guidance and support.  I suggested that for specific
technical details he forward his needs via Ontyme to ensure accuracy of
detail rather than to rely on phone conversation but I saw fairly few
Ontymes as we seemed to cover a few different items each time he called.
It was not until he apparently recently actually received a PICO to work
with in the lab that a clear Ontyme was exchanged between Bruce and Laurie
where Bruce specified in detail the specific patches for the applications
that Laurie and I had previously discussed verbally along with some clear
configuration parameters unique to PICO which were not required on TSI.
Bruce again at that time extended the offer to assist Laurie directly
should he require assistance again.

	Typically in the tech support group we encounter engineers engaged
in nontrivial projects such as the BSF effort and the general attitiude in
the group is to extend the offer of assistance to competent personnel as
long as they do not abuse the offer.  At times we do encounter individuals
and even organizations who will tax the resources of our technical support
group or individuals within the group.  When this situation arises I rarely
waste much time in flagging the problem to my management and the appropriate
parties as we simply do not have enough engineers within the group to
perform tasks assigned to other organzations.  From my perspective Laurie
Hughes had not fallen into the area of abusing our resources.

	It was only recently when you presented me with an error message
which I evaluated to be a call cleared as a result of some high level
protocol error that I suspected a possible fundamental problem with the
BSF testing.  Then again shortly thereafter when Laurie reported having
difficulties with a byte sync port connection on PICO which I had explicitly
discouraged in previous conversations I became concerned as to what exactly
was being proposed, tested and installed for the bank.  Following that I
actually encouraged Bruce to pursue clarifying Laurie's testing and test
equipment to protect the interest of both BT-Tymnet and the bank.  Some of
the last things Bruce worked on with Laurie were problems that seemed
inconsistent with the revision level of hardware he reported to be using
as a test platform.  It was in this time period that I became aware of
another level of problems apparently between Laurie and other organizations
at corporate headquarters.  The last two exchanges between myself, Bruce
and Laurie were spent trying to give Laurie a sense of support and calming
as he seemed to be in need of moral support as much as technical support.
Approximately 15-August-90 the last technical support was exchanged 
between Bruce and Laurie and about 20-August-90 we had our last conversation
which was totally non-technical.  Laurie was obviously concerned regarding
his position with the company and in need of emotional support which I
did try to convey to him to help restore his balance.  There were no
other exchanges thereafter.
