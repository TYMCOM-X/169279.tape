The   purpose   of  this  document  is  to  outline  the  equipment  and

procedures   required  to  complete  the  final  assembly  of  the  HDLC

Micro-Engine  to  the  STM  TXR-xxxx indoor unit.  This integration test

involves  two  major  components:  assembling  of  the  two  units and a

functionality  test  of the complete package.  This test requires that a

known  good  RF  package  be  available for use during the functionality

testing  phase.   In  the  appendix  are two sections describing the SIO

signal  loopback  options  and the LEDs on both the TXR-2100 indoor unit

and  HDLC  Micro-Engine.   Additionally, an attachment detailing the STM

assembly work flow process is also included.  





This  document  is  divided into 7 sections:  Introduction, Work Station

Environment,  Required  Equipment,  Assembly  Instruction, Functionality

Test Procedures, PC Loading Procedures and Appendix.  





The  first  section, this Introduction, describes the scope and overview

of this document.  





The  second  section,  Work  Station  Environment,  describes  the  work

station required and general process flow through it.  





The  third  section, Required Equipment, describes the minimum equipment

(hardware, software and documentation) necessary.  





The  fourth  section, Assembly Instruction, describes the assembly steps

to integrate the STM TXR-xxx and HDLC Micro-Engine into a single unit.  





The  fifth  section,  Functionality  Testing  Procedures,  describes the

testing  required  to  verify  the  integrity  of  the complete TXR-2100

unit.  





The  sixth  section,  PC  Loading Instructions, describes the procedures

necessary for loading and executing ISIS code via a PC.  





The   seventh   section,  Appendix,  contains  other  items  of  general

information relevent to this process.

This  section  will attempt to outline the specifics concerning the work

station  environment  required  and the general process flow through the

work  station.   The  work  station will be divided into two areas: live

testing  via  the  STM  satellite  network  and  testing  via  hardwired

terrestrial  lines.   A  breakdown  of  the  two  different  areas is as

follows: 





    o  24  hours  of  live STM satellite network testing using ISIS code

       and  the  XRAY  DB  command  to  generate  an  adequate amount of

       traffic  between  the  Central  Hub  and  the Micro Earth Station

       (MES)  to  test the satellite connection.  This step will require

       assigning  of  a permanent STM station ID number to Manufacturing

       for  use  in  the  on-air  testing.  A periodic monitoring of the

       performance  of  the  MES  will  be  required  to  insure that no

       problems are occurring.  





    o  24  hours of diagnostics and live network testing via terrestrial

       lines  using  the  same ISIS code, but introducing the Throughput

       host  to  generate  extended  amounts of traffic.  The diagnostic

       portion  of this step will take approximately 2-3 hours, with the

       remainder  of  time  for  live  testing.   This step will require

       connectivity  to the Manufacturing network and a dedicated TYMNET

       Mini-Engine  with  two  (2)  SIO mother boards and eight (8) V.24

       cards.   A periodic monitoring of the performance of the MES will

       be required to insure that no problems are occurring.

This  section  describes  the  step  by  step  procedures  necessary for

assembling  the  STM  TXR-xxxx  and  HDLC  Micro-Engine  into  a  single

TXR-2100 unit.  



The  Assembly  Instructions section consists of four components:  Muffin

Fan  assembly installation, Micro-Engine assembly installation, DC power

check-out, and Video Kit installation.  





1.  Muffin Fan assembly installation: 



    o  Install  the  Muffin  Fan  assembly to the left side panel of the

       unit  (looking  from  the  front),  using  two  screws  with lock

       washers  and  nuts  at  the side panel, and using two screws with

       lock washers at the front and rear cross bars.  



    o  Connect the Muffin Fan power connector to the power supply.

2.  Micro-Engine assembly installation: 



    o  Install  the Micro-Engine assembly to front cross bar of the unit

       using  the  two  screws  on the front cross bar. The Micro-Engine

       has  to  be  placed  on the unit so that the power terminal block

       will be to the front of the unit.  



    o  Connect  the DC power harness to the power terminal block located

       on  the  Micro-Engine  assembly.  Refer  to  Diagram  1  for wire

       connection.  



    o  Connect  S1  and  S2  cables  to  the  two LEDs on the unit front

       panel.    S1  connects to the "POWER" LED, and S2 connects to the

       "RUN" LED.  



3.  DC power check-out: 



    ****  CCAAUUTTIIOONN::   DDOOUUBBLLEE  CCHHEECCKK  AALLLL  CCOONNNNEECCTTIIOONNSS VVEERRYY CCAARREEFFUULLLLYY BBEEFFOORREE

       PPOOWWEERRIINNGG UUPP UUNNIITT!!  **** 



    o  Apply power to the unit.  



    o  With  a  Voltmeter, verify the presence of all DC power levels on

       the DC  power terminal block according to Diagram 1.  



    o  With  a  voltmeter, measure across The RED and BLACK wires on the

       power  connector  of  the Micro-Engine Memory board. This voltage

       should be 5.15 Volts +/-1%.

4.  Video kit installation.  



   Each  video  kit  comes  with  a 50 Ohms video splitter and two short

   coax   cables.   The  video  splitter  has one input terminal and two

   output  terminals.  The video splitter is to be installed between the

   internal  receive  cable  (the 2 inch cable that connects the receive

   connector  on  the  TXR2100's back pannel to the A1J1-RX connector on

   the satellite modem) and the satellite modem.  



    o  Disconnect  the internal receive cable (labeled 345-5046-2A) from

       the A1J1-RX connector on satellite modem.  



    o  Connect  the  internal receive cable (labeled 345-5046-2A) to the

       input terminal of the video splitter.  



    o  Connect  the  two  short  coax  cables to output terminals of the

       video splitter.  



    o  Connect  one  of  the  two  ouput  coax  cables  to  the  A1J1-RX

       connector on  satellite modem.  



    o  Connect the second output coax cable to the VIDEO connector.

The   following  diagram   depicts the  power bar  connections  for  the

STM  TXR-xxxx  and   the  HDLC  Micro-Engine.  It is  important to  note

that   the  +/-  SENSE  wires  connect to HDLC Micro-Engine side of  the

power  bar.  These allow the voltage flow to the HDLC Micro-Engine to be

leveled  at  5.1.   Without  these  return wires the voltages can run as

high   as  5.6,  thereby  causing  possible  problems  within  the  HDLC

Micro-Engine.

The  Functionality  Test  Procedures is divided into three phases:  HDLC

Micro-Engine  diagnostics, live testing across the STM satellite network

and testing outside of the STM satellite network.   



The  first  phase  involves placing the test unit into boot, loading and

executing the following diagnostics: 



    o  DCPU  (CPU diagnostic) 

    o  DMAC  (MAC diagnostic) 

    o  DMEM  (Memory Diagnostic) 

    o  DSIO  (SIO diagnostic) 







The  second  phase involves changing the STM Station ID on the TAM board

to  match  the Manufacturing Station ID, placing the test unit into boot

and  loading a BND file that contains ISIS node code.  Once the node has

been  taken over by the network supervisor, the  XRAY delay measurements

command  will be issued to simulate traffic through the  node across the

STM  satellite  link.  After all satellite network testing  is complete,

resetting the unit to the original STM Station ID is necessary.  



The configuration of the Sync ports will be as follows:  



    o  SYNC 8 will be connected to DUPLEX 1 on the TXR-2100 

    o  SYNC 1-7 and SYNC 9-10 will be unused.  







The  third  step  involves  loading  the  same  ISIS code from phase two

(above),  and  introducting  the  THROUGHPUT  HOST  to  simulate traffic

across  each  Sync  line  which will be connected to a referenced (known

good) TYMNET Mini-Engine in the Manufacturing network.  



The configuration of the Sync ports will be as follows:  



    o  SYNC 1-10 will be hardwired to the Referenced Mini-Engine 







An  expanded  view  of  the  Integration Work Station environment can be

found in Section 2, Work Station Environment.

The  HDLC  Micro-Engine  Diagnostic phase involves loading and executing

the  four  main diagnostics involved in the HDLC Micro-Engine structure.

The  four  diagnostics  are  CPU,  MAC,  Memory,  and  SIO and should be

executed in that order.  





The  four  diagnostics must run error-free through the default tests for

each  diagnostics at least one time, except the SIO which is required to

run  10  complete passes with all ports being selected (Sync and Async).

A  prerequisite  for  the  SIO  diagnostic  is  that the appropriate SIO

Sync/Async loopback plugs be connected to the HDLC Micro-Engine.  





There  is  no  need  for  any network connectivity during the diagnostic

testing  phase  as  all  code  loading  should be done via the PC.  This

phase  of  the   testing  can  be  done  at  the  same  location as Live

Terrestrial Network Testing (phase 3).  





Creation  of  diagnostics  or  upgrading of existing diagnostics on a PC

can  be  accomplished  by  following  the  procedures  outlined  in  the

document titled TI Pro-Lite File Transfer Procedures.  





A  description  of  each  of  the  diagnostic  tests  and  its operating

instructions  can  be  found in the appropriate diagnostic User's Guide.

The  current  versions  and locations of each diagnostic can be found in

the  HTS  Diagnostic  Release  Procedures  document  or  on  any  of the

diagnostic code systems under the file (ENGDIAG)RELEAS.DAT.

The  Live  STM  Satellite  Network Testing phase is intended to test the

functionality  of  the  TXR-2100  during  live  operation within the STM

satellite  network.   This  phase  of  the testing involves changing the

TXR-2100  STM  Satellite  network  Station ID (located on the TAM board)

placing  the test unit into boot, loading ISIS code and running the XRAY

Delay   Measurements   command  (DB)  to  simulate  traffic  across  the

satellite network.

The  basic  equipment  required  for  this  phase  of  the testing is as

follows: 



   o  Micro-Engine front console and cabling 

   o  TI PC or IBM PC (XT or clone) 

   o  One (1) straight-though cable (ASC140-02) 





The  step  by  step procedure to accomplish this phase of the testing is

as follows: 



1.  Connect the front console to the Micro-Engine.  



2.   Connect the PC to the Multifunction port on the Micro-Engine, using

the standard straight-through cable ASC140-02.   



3.   Set the multifunction port baud rate according to the directions in

Step 3 of the Phase 1 Diagnostics section above.  



4.   Insure that all Sync ports are set as 9600 baud by setting the baud

rate  selector  switch  located  on  the  HDLC  I/O  board  at locations

SW11-SW20 at 4.  



5.   Write  down  the  current dip switch settings on the STM TAM board,

and   change  the  dip  switches  to correspond to the Manufacturing STM

Satellite Network Station ID.  



6.   Place  the  HDLC Micro-Engine into boot by toggling the boot switch

located at the top-center of the TXR-2100.  



7.   Using the instructions outlined in the PC Load Procedures, load the

ISIS  node  bound  file named ND####.BND.  It is recommended that the PC

loading  method  be  used, but any other synchronous load process may be

used (such as ELF or LOADII).  



8.   Once the node has been taken over by the active network supervisor,

using  the  PC  connected  to  the multifunction port, log into XRAY and

issue  the  build  delay measurement (DB) command.  This command will be

the   non-privileged  version, which will require no further interaction

from the user issuing it.

9.   Periodic monitoring of the performance of the TXR-2100 will be done

via  issuance  of  the  XRAY  commands  to display node statistics (NS),

display  link  statistics (KS) and to read the sio status registers (R).

This  period monitoring should be on a minimum of once every hour during

working  hours,  coupled  with hardcopy display at the start of the test

period and at the end of the test period.  



10.  Reset the STM Station ID on the TAM board to original ID.

The  important  fields in the output from the DD command are the CPS and

STAT  fields.   If  the  CPS  is  0,  then no traffic is being generated

across  the  lines  and  an error condition has occurred previously.  If

the  STAT   command is 0001 the circuit is up, FFFE or FFFF indicate the

circuit has been zapped and is not longer active.  





The  important  fields in the KS command link characteristics CPS in and

out  being  greater  than  0,  bandwidth utilization and rexmissions not

being   excessive.  A small amount of retransmissions is acceptable, but

should  this  continue to increase at a rapid rate the HDLC Micro-Engine

needs further troubleshooting.

The   Terrestrial   Network  Testing  phase  is  intended  to  test  the

functionality  of all HDLC Micro-Engine Sync and Async ports during live

operation  within  the Manufacturing network.  This phase of the testing

involves  placing  the  test  unit into boot, loading the same ISIS code

used  in  Phase  2  (Live STM Satellite Network Testing) and introducing

the  THROUGHPUT  HOST  to  generate  traffic between the test node and a

referenced TYMNET Mini-Engine.  



The  basic  equipment  required  for  this  phase  of  the testing is as

follows: 



   o  1 Referenced TYMNET Mini-Engine 

   o  Micro-Engine front console and cabling 

   o  TI PC or IBM PC (XT or clone) 

   o  One (1)  straight-though cable (ASC140-02)

The  step  by  step procedure to accomplish this phase of the testing is

as follows: 





1.  Connect the front console to the Micro-Engine.  



2.   Connect the PC to the Multifunction port on the Micro-Engine, using

the standard straight-through cable ASC140-02.   



3.   Set the multifunction port baud rate according to the directions in

Step 3 of the Phase 1 Diagnostics section above.  



4.   Insure that all Sync ports are set as 9600 baud by setting the baud

rate  selector  switch  located  on  the  HDLC  I/O  board  at locations

SW11-SW20 at 4.  



5.   Place  the  HDLC Micro-Engine into boot by toggling the boot switch

located at the top-center of the TXR-2100.  



6.   Using the instructions outlined in the PC Load Procedures, load the

ISIS  node  bound  file named ND####.BND.  It is recommended that the PC

loading  method  be  used, but any other synchronous load process may be

used (such as ELF or LOADII).  

















TYMSTAR INTEGRATION PROCEDURES                                   Page 15





7.   Once the node has been taken over by the active network supervisor,

using  the  PC  connected  to  the  multifunction  port,  log into a DDT

username  and  issue  the  THROUGHPUT HOST commands to begin the traffic

flow  between  the  TXR-2100 and TYMNET Mini-Engine in the Manufacturing

network.

8.   Following  completion  of the required testing time frame (combined

24  hours  between  HDLC  Micro-Engine  Diagnostic  (Phase  1)  and Live

Terrestrial  Network  Testing,  return the Watchdog Timer to the enabled

position  by putting dip switch 3 at Selector switch 10W into the closed

poisition.

The  PC  Loading  Instructions  section is intended to provide the basic

directions  for the loading of diagnostic or bound files directly from a

PC  to  the  HDLC  Micro-Engine.   It  should be noted that the Watchdog

Timer  (located at 10W switch 4) should be disabled prior to loading via

the   PC.    The  following  steps  apply  equally  to  either  a  Texas

Instruments PC, IBM PC or XT or IBM clone.  



The  following  diagram  depicts  the  connection  of the PC to the HDLC

Micro-Engine:

The  transferring  of  files  between  the  PC and the HDLC Micro-Engine

involves  connecting the PC Comm port directly to the Multifunction port

on  the  HDLC  Micro-Engine.   It must be noted that a front  console is

necessary  for  execution of the NIB or BND file once it is loaded.  The

transfer  rate  from  the PC is solely dependent upon the speed selected

on  the  multifunction  port  on the Micro-Engine.  The transfer process

involves the following steps: 



   o  Connecting the PC to the HDLC Micro-Engine Multifunction port 



   o  Invoking the TERMITE program by typing the following: 



         TTEERRMMIITTEE DDUUMMBB 11 <<ssppeeeedd>>  



   o  Type an ALT-X.  



   o  Initializing    the    transfer   process   by   typing   "TTYLOAD

      <pc-filename>"  followed  by  a  carriage  return.  This step will

      direct  the  user  to  place  the  machine  in  boot and enter the

      following on the console: 



          DDTTAA SSEETT DDTTAA 6600 AADDRR  



      which  will  allow  the  machine  to  receive the file being sent.

      Following  this  a carriage return is typed on the PC and the file

      transfer  begins,  with  the display on the Micro-Engine's console

      cycling  through  the  addresses  received.   When the transfer is

      complete,  the  leftmost  5  digits  on  the  Engines console will

      display  "F  FFFF"  is  the  transfer was successful.  If anything











TYMSTAR INTEGRATION PROCEDURES                                   Page 17





      other  than  "F FFFF" is displayed, the transfer must be attempted

      again.  



   o  At  this  point the object file just sent is ready to be executed.

      The following instructions are entered via the console: 



         DDTTAA SSEETT DDTTAA <<ssttaarrtt>> AADDRR RRUUNN 



         where 

            <start> = 0A00 is file loaded was a diagnostic file 

            <start> = 0070 if file loaded was a bound file 



   o  At  this  point  the Engine will begin executing the code.  If the

      code  was  a  diagnostic  program  the  PC  will  now  display the

      diagnostic  banner and prompt indicating the PC is now acting as a

      terminal  connected  to the Multifunction port.  If the file was a

      bound  file,  the  node  will  begin  the  process  of bringup and

      entrance into the network.

   LED1  -   TDM  lock  indicator.   This LED will be illuminated in red

      when  the  incoming  syncronization  pattern  in  the TDM frame is

      lost.   This  indicates   a  significant  error  and  should be be

      brought  to  the attention of support personnel immediately.  This

      indicator  can  not  be  illuminated  at  the  same  time  as LED4

      (Network Lock).  



   LED2  -   Decoded  lock  indicator.   This LED will be illuminated in

      green  when  the  signal  from  the  satellite  is  of  sufficient

      strength  for  proper  operation.   Failure to obtain decoder lock

      may  indicate  a significant error and should be be brought to the

   LED9  -   Power  indicator.   This green LED will be illuminated when

      the indoor unit has been powered on.  



   LED10 -    Run  indicator.   This  green  LED  will  flash  when  the

      microcode  is  executing  in a normal fashion.  Additionally, this

      LED  will  be  illuminated  when  the  Micro-Engine is running the

      boot.   This LED will either be flashing or solid whenever code is

      running, it does not indicate what code is running.
