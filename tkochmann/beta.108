--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	As of last night, Sat., Nov. 4, Emery Freight delivered 9 of the
expected 10 units for alpha and beta testing of the 1.08 revisions.
Physically the incoming units appear to be undamaged.  Mon., Nov. 6 will
be spent upgrading the units.  As available each unit will be brought up
on the CPU and MAC diagnostics.  There is no SIO diagnostic available at
this time so each unit will be brought up under ISIS and each I/O device
tested via SLOT SIO, SYNC, ASYNC exercisers.  By Wed., Nov. 8 the units
will be brought up with actual field target code and strapping options
and subjected to load testing.  By Fri., Nov.10 units should be ready to
ship to specific field locations for actual on-line performance testing.

	Additionally we will be sending the latest ECO package to Dave
Rees at ANZ bank who has expressed an interest in performing controlled
lab tests with the upgrade using their Async and SDLC interfaces.  Jean
Van Waterschoot is positioned to accept an upgrade kit to test with and
evaluate the emulated sync control signal revisions as he actually has
a demo which requires the byte-sync half duplex signal exchange.  The
new firmware will also be sent to Bruce at HKSBC to introduce and test
with prior to returning home.  HKSBC has elected to load the box to
101% of expected capacity and perform concurrent Node Code, X.25, Async
and 3270 Byte-sync on each machine under test.

	Given that all schedules are maintained without slips and no
new problems arise either in the lab or field units I expect a reasonable
early release date of Nov. 17, 1989 to bring manufacturing back on-line.
Additionally by that time we will either have a working diagnostic which
they can use to test the units or we will have an acceptable workaround
procedure similar to the one we will use this week to bring up the
upgraded units.  I do not recommend releasing the product hold at this
time as we require the test time to verify product integrity.  Recall
that I required firmware revisions to send to Bruce not even one full
day after he left for field testing with HKSBC and three days after
that yet another change.  At this time I can not report any obvious
"bugs" but then again we have much more testing to perform.  My plan
of lab and field testing is quite aggressive.  I am suggesting a two
week beta type test scenario as opposed to the usual minimal 90 days.
