        FUNCTION - lists  the instruction mnemonic, instruction format
        type, and parameters peculiar  to the instruction being timed.

        e.g.  LM   RX1 REG 0    Load Multiple, RX1 format, 64 bytes
              WD   RX3 T/O      I/O instruction Timed Out

        LOOP TIMING -  the basic time to execute the test loop without
        an actual instruction inserted into the timing loop.  This forms
        the basis for establishing all other timings.

        MACHINE RATING - this rating is based on the JPPU rating described
        below.  It reflects the rate of transfer ability to move one byte of
        data from one memory location to another memory location via the
        lowest common denominator instruction set.  i.e.  Load/Store Byte.
        This provides us with a "horsepower" equivalent which can be used
        to determine relative power variations of different machines.
        e.g.  In relative terms, a machine rating of 45.45 would basically be
              2.536 times as as powerful as a machine rating of 17.92

        TIMING - average time stated in microseconds to execute the
        instruction.  This is averaged over the specified instruction sample
        rate.  Where the instruction sample rate is 180 seconds, the
        instruction loop is run for 180 seconds and calculations derived over
        this time period.  Refer to instruction calculation definitions for
        details.

        MIPS - million instructions per second is derived from the instruction
        timing where one microsecond instruction timing is equivalent to one
        MIP.

        JPPU -  Jonas's Processing Power Unit is a rating system designed to
        reflect the ability to do work.  The JPPU factor is a unit of power
        equal to moving 10,000 bytes of data from one memory location to
        another memory location within one second.

        e.g.  A JPPU rating of 106.56 indicates this instruction is capable
              of moving data internally at a rate of 1,065,600 bytes per
              second.

        The JPPU for a single phase instruction such as the Load RX2 takes
        into account a 4 byte transfer and one half transfer cycle in
        such a manner that if combined with a Store RX2, the relative power
        is the approximate average of the two.

        e.g.  If Load RX2 JPPU = 200
              & Store RX2 JPPU = 185

              The effective JPPU is:  (200+185)/2= 192.5
              192.5 x 10,000 = 1,925,000 bytes/second transfer capability

        RAW DATA - this column simply reflects test loop counts achieved
        during test execution over the period of time indicated in the sample
        rate.  This is only used for verification purposes.

        TOTAL AVERAGE MIPS - the average million instructions per second
        derived from total instruction time which reflects all instructions
        executed and timed.  This figure is used for verification purposes
        and is not intended to reflect true machine power since it includes
        duplicate and worst case timings.

        TOTAL INSTR TIME - total instruction  time is simply the addition
        of all instruction execution times and used for verification purposes.
        It is not intended to reflect true machine power since it includes
        duplicate and worst case timings.

        SELECTED TIMING STATISTICS - these timing statistics reflect true
        timings based on instruction format type.  Instructions marked with a
        (+) have been excluded for reasons of being redundant, special 
        application, or not normally utilized in the manner tested.

                TOTAL TIME - addition of all instruction timings for the
                specified instruction format.

                AVERAGE TIME - average time derived by dividing the total
                time by the number of instructions included in total time
                for the specified instruction format.

                TOTAL MIPS - addition of all instruction mips for the 
                specified instruction format.

                AVERAGE MIPS - average mips derived by dividing the total
                mips by the number of instructions included in total mips
                for the specified instruction format.
