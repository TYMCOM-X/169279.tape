
Dan:

	I looked at your files and it appears that you have all that
you require.  I did however notice that the ASYNC ports needed to be
modified.  I believe that was the result of the sample Tymfile that
I directed you to being modified by a search and substitute edit.  I've
taken the liberty to make the necessary corrections and reassemble the
code.  Also please observe the System Performance Analysis Monitor equate
statement is SPAM not SPUM.  You will execute the command ?SPAM in slot
FF to recover the monitor data.  Please notice the new log file.  

	I seem to be just a little short of time these days so if you
find yourself in need of direct response from me please feel free to 
send me system messages at (TKOCHMANN:33/37) or call me at home even
at 408/371-8507 any time.

Best wishes and enjoy;

Tim
