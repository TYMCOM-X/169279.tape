                                      1.1  SCOPE


             This support plan provides the procedures necessary to support the
        TURBO-ENGINE product.






                               1.2  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION


             The TURBO-ENGINE  product is  the latest of  the TYMNET  family of
        modular Engines.   The machine  is targetted to  process a  minimum 384
        Kilobytes of data per second.   This will allow a minimum of  1500 X.25
        packets per second (128 bytes  per packet) or 3000 Tymnet  T201 packets
        per second per each fully populated machine footprint.

             The system  architecture is  based on the  Motorola 68K  family of
        microprocessors providing an  environment which insures  future product
        growth.  TURBO-ENGINE utilizes  the industry standard VMEbus  and EURO-
        pak packaging  form factors.  TURBO-ENGINE  also provides a  local file
        server for local Winchester Disk Drive operations.

             TURBO-ENGINE General Processor boards and IOC boards  utilize CMOS
        and  NMOS  VLSI devices.  These  devices require  less  power  than the
        currently used  SSI, MSI  and LSI devices  utilized by  previous Tymnet
        Engines.     The  higher functionality  per chip  density equates  to a
        reduced  number  of  devices per  application  reducing  the  number of
        component interconnections and  the probability of  associated failures
        in addition to having long operational life-cycles.

             Redundancy for processors and power supplies will be available.

             Physical interface boards meet RS-232C/V.24, V.35, RS422-423/RS449
        standard specifications.

             FCC,  UL  certified.   Designed  to  meet  VDE,  IEC-435  and OSHA
        computer room standards.

             Network management utilities  are modified to retrieve  and report
        TURBO-ENGINE local error/event logs from system disk.






                               1.3  MAINTENANCE STRATEGY


             ISOM-68K (also known as ALFRED) debugging facility  is implemented
        in the TURBO-ENGINE environment.  System diagnostics are stored  on the
        local  system disk  and on  board PROM.  Diagnostics will  also  be DLL
        (Down-Line-Loaded) as required for fault isolation/identification.

             Non standard debugger PROM sets will be available  for maintenance
        and failure  identification. These PROMs  may be installed  for initial
        bring-up  of TURBO-ENGINE  but  are primarily  for use  by  board level
        technicians at  MFG and repair  facilities.  NTS will  control release,
        documentation  and distribution  of  these test  packages.   These test
        packages are PHASE I  specific and necessary as more  Standard Loadable
        Diagnostics are still under development and dynamic.


             The TURBO-ENGINE system is to be repaired on site using  the board
        swap-out  concept.  Mean  Time To  Repair will  be no  greater  than 30
        minutes.

             Loading of the  software target code can  also be through  the DLL
        facility or restored from the local system disk.

        Calculated MTBF         56000 hours
        (The failure rate used in this calculation has been derived from the
        British Telecom Reliability Handbook using method HRD3).


        - The file server processor board (FS) is a GP board
          (same Tadpole board TP21). But on the file server, the
          VME-Bus Arbiter (purely hardware function) is enabled and the
          on-board SCSI bus controller interfaces with the system disk. 
          The system disk is a part of the file server system that
          will reside in on-board PROM.
          Per VME-bus specification, the system controller resides in slot 1
          (most left slot in VME sub-rack). But, any GP with Arbiter enabled
          can function as a system controller and with PROM change can
          function in slot 1 as a file server. 


        - Two versions of I/O controller boards have been defined (IOC4 and
          IOC8). Both are double height VME boards. IOC's are designed and
          manufactured within ISG.

        - Three versions of the paddle board have been defined.
          paddle boards are used to convert the TTL level signals at 
          the P2 interface of the IOCX board into level shifted signals
          for the various electrical interfaces (i.e. RS232C/V24, V.35 and
          RS422).

                        2.10  SERVICE PHILOSOPHY AND/OR PROCESS


            A.MAINTENANCE PHILOSOPHY

            Field repair will consist of fault isolation to the module or the
            board level (defined as troubleshooting level 1 in the NTS service
            guide). 

            Defective item will be tagged and sent to the appropriate
            repair center following standard defective material return
            procedures as defined in FSCO Support Plan.

            Manufacturing MUST DEFINE all negotiated vendor purchase agreements
            particularly as regards to Tadpole GP's, disk drives and power
            supplies.  (TO BE PROVIDED BY MFG 3Q 88)    

            B.MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES

            Preventive maintenance will be performed every 12 months.

            Power supply system will be checked systematically at the beginning
            of any field servicing.
            Special CAUTION should be exercised when servicing machine and
            power supply systems due to charged capacitors, non-insulated 
            DC bus bars and possible "180 AMPS" current surge on the +5 V.
            Power Supply Replacement Procedure should be followed (to be
            provided by NTD 3Q 88).             

            Power Supply MTBF > or = 100 000 hours

            Monitor panels provide power level test points. Power supplies
            provide DC good and AC fail signals.

            Filters and cooling cards (Flumes) are removable for
            cleaning. PC boards and disk trays will be vacuumed to prevent dust
            build up around sensitive ESD components.

            Qantum system disks require no preventive maintenance.
            Qantum Q200 series MTBF 25,000 POH (power on hours)
                "   "     "    start/stop 10,000 cycles
                
            MTBF= mean time between failure > or = 5 years
            MTTR= mean time to repair < or = 30 minutes
                

            C.INTERRUPT OF CUSTOMER SERVICE

            Customer service will be interrupted during any system hardware
            servicing. There will be no power-on hot swap of any failed
            components. Any or all chassis may need to be powered down.

            D.MAINTENANCE REPORTING 

            Any service performed will be reported on the standard Field
            Service report form (FSR form) using Field Service report codes

            E.SPARING ALLOCATIONS
             
            Actual sparing will depend on product relialibility, density, and
            number of FE's in a given office. The table below shows the 
            quota of spares recommended by NTS.

        TROUBLESHOOTING TOOLS AND DIAGNOSTICS                  February 2, 1988






                      3 -  TROUBLESHOOTING TOOLS AND DIAGNOSTICS


            There  are 3  levels of  diagnostics for  the  TURBO-ENGINE system.
        The first level is  the minimum card test  and the second level  is the
        minimum interboard communications test.  Level 1 and 2  diagnostics are
        currently  implemented in  TURBO-ENGINE product  release  1.0.      The
        third  level  is  the comprehensive  diagnostics  for  the TURBO-ENGINE
        system.  Level  3 diagnostics  will  not be  available  in TURBO-ENGINE
        product release 1.0 .

            The first and second levels of diagnostics make up a power  on self
        test (POST) in  PROM that verifies  the minimum functions  necessary to
        support  TURBO-SCP's execution  (TURBO-SCP  is also  known  as Rodney).
        Every system in the field will execute these POST's every time a system
        is powered or reset.

            The third  level is loadable  and is intended  to check  all system
        functions. The  comprehensive diagnostics  for the  TURBO-ENGINE system
        allow the user to evaluate a wide range of the system functions  and to
        isolate  failing  field  replaceable  units  during   installation  and
        maintenance.

             We anticipate that  Field personnel will  benefit from level  1, 2
        and 3 diagnostics. This presumes that Senior level FEs will be assigned
        to TURBO-ENGINE project during early project phase.

             Diagnostics include  initialization, reset, boot,  display, modify
        and trace facilities. Diagnostics are accessible locally and  will also
        be accessible through the network.

                      systems have a single PC board, called the J1 backplane.
                      It provides the signal paths needed for basic operation.
                      Other VMEbus systems also have an optional second PC
                      board, called a J2 backplane. It provides the additional
                      96 pin connectors and signal paths needed for wider data
                      and address transfer. Still others (Turbo-engine) have
                      a single PC board that provided the signal conductors and
                      connectors of both the J1 and the J2 backplanes.

                      mass-storage asynchronous peripherals to a speed
                      up to 2.0 MBPS. SCSI can support up to 7 peripherals and
                      also system to system communications. SCSI has been
                      designed as an extension of the Shugart's SASI bus.

        SUBRACK       A rigid framework that provides mechanical support for
                      boards, ensuring that the connectors mate properly and
                      that adjacent boards do not contact each other. It also
                      guides the cooling airflow through the system, and

                      ensures that inserted boards do not disengage themselves
                      from the backplane due to vibration or shock.

        SYSTEM 
        CONTROLLER    A board which resides in slot 1 of a VMEbus backplane 
                      and has a "system clock driver", a "dtb arbiter" an
                      "iack daisy chain driver", and a bus timer.
                      Some also have a serial clock driver, a power monitor ,
                      or both.

        VMEbus        VERSA MODULAR EUROPEAN BUS
                      An adaptation of Motorola's VERSAbus defined in 
                      response to market requirements (esp. European).
                      Whereas VERSAbus is better suited to higher
                      performance, more complex systems, VMEbus is
                      designed to target low end process control and
                      intelligent terminals applications.  Use of more
                      sophisticated LSI and VLSI devices on the smaller
                      cards of VMEbus makes the VMEbus better suited for
                      more complex systems.  The VMEbus is a non-multiplexed
                      asynchronous bus structure for up to 40Mbytes.
