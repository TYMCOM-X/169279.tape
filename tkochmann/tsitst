                                   1 -  INTRODUCTION


             This  document describes  the  steps in  the testing  of  ISIS and
        associated  interfaces  in  the  TSI  environment.  Each  section  will
        describe the environment required,  the functionality to be  tested and
        the criteria for the successful completion of that specific section.

                             2 -  ISIS WITHOUT RELOCATION


             This will be the first attempt to run ISIS in the TSI environment.
        ISIS will be  run with no interfaces  present. In this state  ISIS will
        only be actively scheduling  one internal ISIS process. This  test will
        verify the reliablity  of the instruction  set and the  real-time clock
        and also  verify that ISIS  machine dependent considerations  have been
        accounted  for.   At this  stage  the functionality  of  most  ISIS DDT
        commands can be  verified.  This stage will  be verified by  looking at
        the  ISIS internal  timers and  the processing  scheduling.  The "front
        panel" should also display the ISIS speedometer.






                                   2.1  Environment


             The following hardware/firmware environment is required:

                o  Functional Engine instruction set

                o  TTY port

                o  Console (CIO instruction)

                o  Real-time clock interrupt

                o  Method to load NIB format files into EP memory

                o  Method to create a parity error

                            2.2  Functionality to be Tested


             The following sections describe the areas of ISIS to be tested and
        the criteria for successful completion.





                    2.2.1  Scheduling

             One of  the primary jobs  of ISIS is  to provide  scheduling among
        competing multiple processes. Without any interfaces running under ISIS
        only a few internal ISIS processes are being scheduled. One of the ISIS
        processes should update the front panel periodically with the status of
        the  current  slot  being  examined and  the  load  on  the  machine as
        represented by a speedometer consisting of a rotating pair of bits.

             This initial scheduling test will be considered complete  when the
        front  panel is  consistantly updated  with the  slot and  machine load
        information and the DDT processes  in use are scheduled normally  for a
        period of 24 hours.





                    2.2.2  ISIS DDT

             ISIS  has the  capability of  allowing a  user to  access  the DDT
        debugger  through the  TTY port  on the  IOC. When  accessing  DDT, the
        following ISIS mechanisms can be tested: kernel I/O, DDT commands, SVCs
        used by DDT commands.

             This  test   will  be  considered   completed  when  a   user  can
        successfully access DDT through the TTY port and perform  the following
        functions:

                o  DDT commands: M,R,W,X,Y,Z,?SLOT,?VERN,?WHO,?PORT,?HANG
                                 ?TIME,?DIAG,?HIST,?MEM,?CPU,?SYS,^C,^O

                o  The DDT 'R' (read memory) command should be able to display
                   10000x bytes of data at the maximum TTY baud rate without
                   error

                    2.2.3  Exception traps and timers

             ISIS handling of  the Illegal Instruction and  Machine Malfunction
        interrupts will be tested as well as the accuracy of the  internal ISIS
        timers based on the real-time clock.

             This  section will  be  considered completed  when  ISIS correctly
        handles an illegal  instruction and parity  error interrupt as  well as
        the ISIS one second timer (SLOWC) being correct for a 24 hour period.

                               3 -  ISIS WITH RELOCATION


             The first test of relocation will be a simple test slot  that will
        further test the basic ISIS  functionality as well as do a  simple test
        of relocation and protection.






                                   3.1  Environment


             The following additions  to the hardware/firmware  environment are
        required:

                o  MAC relocation and protection

                o  MAC interrupt







                            3.2  Functionality to be Tested






                    3.2.1  Relocation

             The test slot  will perform a simple  memory test to  confirm that
        relocation is working correctly in the ISIS environment. The  test will
        consist of the slot writing  and reading back locations in  its address
        space and  then a  manual verification through  DDT that  the locations
        writen and read are in in fact in the correct area of memory.

             This test will be considered completed when the slot has performed
        the above test  successfully for 24  hours and the  manual verification
        has taken place.

                    3.2.2  ISIS DDT

             Further tests can be performed on ISIS DDT with a slot present.

             This  test will  be considered  completed when  the  following DDT
        functions have been successfully completed:

                o  DDT commands: A,B,D,E,G,H,I,J,N,O,P,Q,RR,T,U,WR
                                 ?B,?ABS,?MAC,?SMAC,?SLOT,?BT,?FT,?BRR
                                 ?FRR,?CT,?USE,?HOST,?EDBG,?LDBG,?FREZ
                                 ?THAW,?STAT,?LMAC,?LU,?TRAN






                    3.2.3  ISIS SVCs

             The test slot will test all of the ISIS SVCs (excluding  I/O SVCs)
        that are not used by any of the previously tested functions.

             This test will be considered completed when the slot  has executed
        these tests successfully for a 24 hour period.





                    3.2.4  Protection trap

             The test slot  will be altered to  create each type  of protection
        violation to test the ISIS handling of the MAC interrupt.

             This test will be considered completed when ISIS  has successfully
        handled a MAC interrupt with all of the possible protection violations.





                    3.2.5  Multiple Slot Configuration

             ISIS will be  test with multiple copies  of the test  slot running
        concurrently.

             This test will be considered completed when ISIS with four  of the
        above  test slots has run successfully for 24 hours.

                           4 -  ISIS WITH RELOCATION AND I/O


             This stage will  consist of ISIS  running an SIO  diagnostic slot.
        This  will  more  fully test  relocation and  also verify  that  SIO is
        working properly.

                               5 -  ISIS WITH NODE CODE


             This stage will  consist of running ISIS  with the Node Code  as a
        node in the network. This will test the ability of ISIS to  function in
        a somewhat standard  fashion. Initially, the  Node Code will  only have
        SIO  lines  but  emmulated  sync  could be  tested  as  well  if  it is
        available.

                                   1 -  INTRODUCTION


             This  document describes  the  steps in  the testing  of  ISIS and
        associated  interfaces  in  the  TSI  environment.  Each  section  will
        describe the environment required,  the functionality to be  tested and
        the criteria for the successful completion of that specific section.

                             2 -  ISIS WITHOUT RELOCATION


             This will be the first attempt to run ISIS in the TSI environment.
        ISIS will be  run with no interfaces  present. In this state  ISIS will
        only be actively scheduling  one internal ISIS process. This  test will
        verify the reliablity  of the instruction  set and the  real-time clock
        and also  verify that ISIS  machine dependent considerations  have been
        accounted  for.   At this  stage  the functionality  of  most  ISIS DDT
        commands can be  verified.  This stage will  be verified by  looking at
        the  ISIS internal  timers and  the processing  scheduling.  The "front
        panel" should also display the ISIS speedometer.






                                   2.1  Environment


             The following hardware/firmware environment is required:

                o  Functional Engine instruction set

                o  TTY port

                o  Console (CIO instruction)

                o  Real-time clock interrupt

                o  Method to load NIB format files into EP memory

                o  Method to create a parity error

                            2.2  Functionality to be Tested


             The following sections describe teas of ISIS to be tested and
        the criteria for successful completion.





                    2.2.1  Scheduling

             One of  the primary jobs  of ISIS is  to provide  scheduling among
        competing multiple processes. Without any interfaces running under ISIS
        only a few internal ISIS processes are being scheduled. One of the ISIS
        processes should update the front panel periodically with the status of
        the  current  slot  being  examined and  the  load  on  the  machine as
        represented by a speedometer consisting of a rotating pair of bits.

             This initial scheduling test will be considered complete  when the
        front  panel is  consistantly updated  with the  slot and  machine load
        information and the DDT processes  in use are scheduled normally  for a
        period of 24 hours.





                    2.2.2  ISIS DDT

             ISIS  has the  capability of  allowing a  user to  access  the DDT
        debugger  through the  TTY port  on the  IOC. When  accessing  DDT, the
        following ISIS mechanisms can be tested: kernel I/O, DDT commands, SVCs
        used by DDT commands.

             This  test   will  be  considered   completed  when  a   user  can
        successfully access DDT through the TTY port and perform  the following
        functions:

                o  DDT commands: M,R,W,X,Y,Z,?SLOT,?VERN,?WHO,?PORT,?HANG
                                 ?TIME,?DIAG,?HIST,?MEM,?CPU,?SYS,^C,^O

                o  The DDT 'R' (read memory) command should be able to display
                   10000x bytes of data at the maximum TTY baud rate without
                   error

                    2.2.3  Exception traps and timers

             ISIS handling of  the Illegal Instruction and  Machine Malfunction
        interrupts will be tested as well as the accuracy of the  internal ISIS
        timers based on the real-time clock.

             This  section will  be  considered completed  when  ISIS correctly
        handles an illegal  instruction and parity  error interrupt as  well as
        the ISIS one second timer (SLOWC) being correct for a 24 hour period.

                               3 -  ISIS WITH RELOCATION


             The first test of relocation will be a simple test slot  that will
        further test the basic ISIS  functionality as well as do a  simple test
        of relocation and protection.






                                   3.1  Environment


             The following additions  to the hardware/firmware  environment are
        required:

                o  MAC relocation and protection

                o  MAC interrupt







                            3.2  Functionality to be Tested






                    3.2.1  Relocation

             The test slot  will perform a simple  memory test to  confirm that
        relocation is working correctly in the ISIS environment. The  test will
        consist of the slot writing  and reading back locations in  its address
        space and  then a  manual verification through  DDT that  the locations
        writen and read are in in fact in the correct area of memory.

             This test will be considered completed when the slot has performed
        the above test  successfully for 24  hours and the  manual verification
        has taken place.

                    3.2.2  ISIS DDT

             Further tests can be performed on ISIS DDT with a slot present.

             This  test will  be considered  completed when  the  following DDT
        functions have been successfully completed:

                o  DDT commands: A,B,D,E,G,H,I,J,N,O,P,Q,RR,T,U,WR
                                 ?B,?ABS,?MAC,?SMAC,?SLOT,?BT,?FT,?BRR
                                 ?FRR,?CT,?USE,?HOST,?EDBG,?LDBG,?FREZ
                                 ?THAW,?STAT,?LMAC,?LU,?TRAN






                    3.2.3  ISIS SVCs

             The test slot will test all of the ISIS SVCs (excluding  I/O SVCs)
        that are not used by any of the previously tested functions.

             This test will be considered completed when the slot  has executed
        these tests successfully for a 24 hour period.





                    3.2.4  Protection trap

             The test slot  will be altered to  create each type  of protection
        violation to test the ISIS handling of the MAC interrupt.

             This test will be considered completed when ISIS  has successfully
        handled a MAC interrupt with all of the possible protection violations.





                    3.2.5  Multiple Slot Configuration

             ISIS will be  test with multiple copies  of the test  slot running
        concurrently.

             This test will be considered completed when ISIS with four  of the
        above  test slots has run successfully for 24 hours.

                           4 -  ISIS WITH RELOCATION AND I/O


             This stage will  consist of ISIS  running an SIO  diagnostic slot.
        This  will  more  fully test  relocation and  also verify  that  SIO is
        working properly.

                               5 -  ISIS WITH NODE CODE


             This stage will  consist of running ISIS  with the Node Code  as a
        node in the network. This will test the ability of ISIS to  function in
        a somewhat standard  fashion. Initially, the  Node Code will  only have
        SIO  lines  but  emmulated  sync  could be  tested  as  well  if  it is
        available.

                                   1 -  INTRODUCTION


             This  document describes  the  steps in  the testing  of  ISIS and
        associated  interfaces  in  the  TSI  environment.  Each  section  will
        describe the environment required,  the functionality to be  tested and
        the criteria for the successful completion of that specific section.

                             2 -  ISIS WITHOUT RELOCATION


             This will be the first attempt to run ISIS in the TSI environment.
        ISIS will be  run with no interfaces  present. In this state  ISIS will
        only be actively scheduling  one internal ISIS process. This  test will
        verify the reliablity  of the instruction  set and the  real-time clock
        and also  verify that ISIS  machine dependent considerations  have been
        accounted  for.   At this  stage  the functionality  of  most  ISIS DDT
        commands can be  verified.  This stage will  be verified by  looking at
        the  ISIS internal  timers and  the processing  scheduling.  The "front
        panel" should also display the ISIS speedometer.






                                   2.1  Environment


             The following hardware/firmware environment is required:

                o  Functional Engine instruction set

                o  TTY port

                o  Console (CIO instruction)

                o  Real-time clock interrupt

                o  Method to load NIB format files into EP memory

                o  Method to create a parity error

                            2.2  Functionality to be Tested


             The following sections describe the areas of ISIS to be tested and
        the criteria for successful completion.





                    2.2.1  Scheduling

             One of  the primary jobs  of ISIS is  to provide  scheduling among
        competing multiple processes. Without any interfaces running under ISIS
        only a few internal ISIS processes are being scheduled. One of the ISIS
        processes should update the front panel periodically with the status of
        the  current  slot  being  examined and  the  load  on  the  machine as
        represented by a speedometer consisting of a rotating pair of bits.

             This initial scheduling test will be considered complete  when the
        front  panel is  consistantly updated  with the  slot and  machine load
        information and the DDT processes  in use are scheduled normally  for a
        period of 24 hours.





                    2.2.2  ISIS DDT

             ISIS  has the  capability of  allowing a  user to  access  the DDT
        debugger  through the  TTY port  on the  IOC. When  accessing  DDT, the
        following ISIS mechanisms can be tested: kernel I/O, DDT commands, SVCs
        used by DDT commands.

             This  test   will  be  considered   completed  when  a   user  can
        successfully access DDT through the TTY port and perform  the following
        functions:

                o  DDT commands: M,R,W,X,Y,Z,?SLOT,?VERN,?WHO,?PORT,?HANG
                                 ?TIME,?DIAG,?HIST,?MEM,?CPU,?SYS,^C,^O

                o  The DDT 'R' (read memory) command should be able to display
                   10000x bytes of data at the maximum TTY baud rate without
                   error

                    2.2.3  Exception traps and timers

             ISIS handling of  the Illegal Instruction and  Machine Malfunction
        interrupts will be tested as well as the accuracy of the  internal ISIS
        timers based on the real-time clock.

             This  section will  be  considered completed  when  ISIS correctly
        handles an illegal  instruction and parity  error interrupt as  well as
        the ISIS one second timer (SLOWC) being correct for a 24 hour period.

                               3 -  ISIS WITH RELOCATION


             The first test of relocation will be a simple test slot  that will
        further test the basic ISIS  functionality as well as do a  simple test
        of relocation and protection.






                                   3.1  Environment


             The following additions  to the hardware/firmware  environment are
        required:

                o  MAC relocation and protection

                o  MAC interrupt







                            3.2  Functionality to be Tested






                    3.2.1  Relocation

             The test slot  will perform a simple  memory test to  confirm that
        relocation is working correctly in the ISIS environment. The  test will
        consist of the slot writing  and reading back locations in  its address
        space and  then a  manual verification through  DDT that  the locations
        writen and read are in in fact in the correct area of memory.

             This test will be considered completed when the slot has performed
        the above test  successfully for 24  hours and the  manual verification
        has taken place.

                    3.2.2  ISIS DDT

             Further tests can be performed on ISIS DDT with a slot present.

             This  test will  be considered  completed when  the  following DDT
        functions have been successfully completed:

                o  DDT commands: A,B,D,E,G,H,I,J,N,O,P,Q,RR,T,U,WR
                                 ?B,?ABS,?MAC,?SMAC,?SLOT,?BT,?FT,?BRR
                                 ?FRR,?CT,?USE,?HOST,?EDBG,?LDBG,?FREZ
                                 ?THAW,?STAT,?LMAC,?LU,?TRAN






                    3.2.3  ISIS SVCs

             The test slot will test all of the ISIS SVCs (excluding  I/O SVCs)
        that are not used by any of the previously tested functions.

             This test will be considered completed when the slot  has executed
        these tests successfully for a 24 hour period.





                    3.2.4  Protection trap

             The test slot  will be altered to  create each type  of protection
        violation to test the ISIS handling of the MAC interrupt.

             This test will be considered completed when ISIS  has successfully
        handled a MAC interrupt with all of the possible protection violations.





                    3.2.5  Multiple Slot Configuration

             ISIS will be  test with multiple copies  of the test  slot running
        concurrently.

             This test will be considered completed when ISIS with four  of the
        above  test slots has run successfully for 24 hours.

                           4 -  ISIS WITH RELOCATION AND I/O


             This stage will  consist of ISIS  running an SIO  diagnostic slot.
        This  will  more  fully test  relocation and  also verify  that  SIO is
        working properly.

                               5 -  ISIS WITH NODE CODE


             This stage will  consist of running ISIS  with the Node Code  as a
        node in the network. This will test the ability of ISIS to  function in
        a somewhat standard  fashion. Initially, the  Node Code will  only have
        SIO  lines  but  emmulated  sync  could be  tested  as  well  if  it is
        available.

                                   1 -  INTRODUCTION


             This  document describes  the  steps in  the testing  of  ISIS and
        associated  interfaces  in  the  TSI  environment.  Each  section  will
        describe the environment required,  the functionality to be  tested and
        the criteria for the successful completion of that specific section.

                             2 -  ISIS WITHOUT RELOCATION


             This will be the first attempt to run ISIS in the TSI environment.
        ISIS will be  run with no interfaces  present. In this state  ISIS will
        only be actively scheduling  one internal ISIS process. This  test will
        verify the reliablity  of the instruction  set and the  real-time clock
        and also  verify that ISIS  machine dependent considerations  have been
        accounted  for.   At this  stage  the functionality  of  most  ISIS DDT
        commands can be  verified.  This stage will  be verified by  looking at
        the  ISIS internal  timers and  the processing  scheduling.  The "front
        panel" should also display the ISIS speedometer.






                                   2.1  Environment


             The following hardware/firmware environment is required:

                o  Functional Engine instruction set

                o  TTY port

                o  Console (CIO instruction)

                o  Real-time clock interrupt

                o  Method to load NIB format files into EP memory

                o  Method to create a parity error

                            2.2  Functionality to be Tested


             The following sections describe the areas of ISIS to be tested and
        the criteria for successful completion.





                    2.2.1  Scheduling

             One of  the primary jobs  of ISIS is  to provide  scheduling among
        competing multiple processes. Without any interfaces running under ISIS
        only a few internal ISIS processes are being scheduled. One of the ISIS
        processes should update the front panel periodically with the status of
        the  current  slot  being  examined and  the  load  on  the  machine as
        represented by a speedometer consisting of a rotating pair of bits.

             This initial scheduling test will be considered complete  when the
        front  panel is  consistantly updated  with the  slot and  machine load
        information and the DDT processes  in use are scheduled normally  for a
        period of 24 hours.





                    2.2.2  ISIS DDT

             ISIS  has the  capability of  allowing a  user to  access  the DDT
        debugger  through the  TTY port  on the  IOC. When  accessing  DDT, the
        following ISIS mechanisms can be tested: kernel I/O, DDT commands, SVCs
        used by DDT commands.

             This  test   will  be  considered   completed  when  a   user  can
        successfully access DDT through the TTY port and perform  the following
        functions:

                o  DDT commands: M,R,W,X,Y,Z,?SLOT,?VERN,?WHO,?PORT,?HANG
                                 ?TIME,?DIAG,?HIST,?MEM,?CPU,?SYS,^C,^O

                o  The DDT 'R' (read memory) command should be able to display
                   10000x bytes of data at the maximum TTY baud rate without
                   error

                    2.2.3  Exception traps and timers

             ISIS handling of  the Illegal Instruction and  Machine Malfunction
        interrupts will be tested as well as the accuracy of the  internal ISIS
        timers based on the real-time clock.

             This  section will  be  considered completed  when  ISIS correctly
        handles an illegal  instruction and parity  error interrupt as  well as
        the ISIS one second timer (SLOWC) being correct for a 24 hour period.

                               3 -  ISIS WITH RELOCATION


             The first test of relocation will be a simple test slot  that will
        further test the basic ISIS  functionality as well as do a  simple test
        of relocation and protection.






                                   3.1  Environment


             The following additions  to the hardware/firmware  environment are
        required:

                o  MAC relocation and protection

                o  MAC interrupt







                            3.2  Functionality to be Tested






                    3.2.1  Relocation

             The test slot  will perform a simple  memory test to  confirm that
        relocation is working correctly in the ISIS environment. The  test will
        consist of the slot writing  and reading back locations in  its address
        space and  then a  manual verification through  DDT that  the locations
        writen and read are in in fact in the correct area of memory.

             This test will be considered completed when the slot has performed
        the above test  successfully for 24  hours and the  manual verification
        has taken place.

                    3.2.2  ISIS DDT

             Further tests can be performed on ISIS DDT with a slot present.

             This  test will  be considered  completed when  the  following DDT
        functions have been successfully completed:

                o  DDT commands: A,B,D,E,G,H,I,J,N,O,P,Q,RR,T,U,WR
                                 ?B,?ABS,?MAC,?SMAC,?SLOT,?BT,?FT,?BRR
                                 ?FRR,?CT,?USE,?HOST,?EDBG,?LDBG,?FREZ
                                 ?THAW,?STAT,?LMAC,?LU,?TRAN






                    3.2.3  ISIS SVCs

             The test slot will test all of the ISIS SVCs (excluding  I/O SVCs)
        that are not used by any of the previously tested functions.

             This test will be considered completed when the slot  has executed
        these tests successfully for a 24 hour period.





                    3.2.4  Protection trap

             The test slot  will be altered to  create each type  of protection
        violation to test the ISIS handling of the MAC interrupt.

             This test will be considered completed when ISIS  has successfully
        handled a MAC interrupt with all of the possible protection violations.





                    3.2.5  Multiple Slot Configuration

             ISIS will be  test with multiple copies  of the test  slot running
        concurrently.

             This test will be considered completed when ISIS with four  of the
        above  test slots has run successfully for 24 hours.

                           4 -  ISIS WITH RELOCATION AND I/O


             This stage will  consist of ISIS  running an SIO  diagnostic slot.
        This  will  more  fully test  relocation and  also verify  that  SIO is
        working properly.

                               5 -  ISIS WITH NODE CODE


             This stage will  consist of running ISIS  with the Node Code  as a
        node in the network. This will test the ability of ISIS to  function in
        a somewhat standard  fashion. Initially, the  Node Code will  only have
        SIO  lines  but  emmulated  sync  could be  tested  as  well  if  it is
        available.
