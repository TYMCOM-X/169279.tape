Subj>	PICO Emulated Sync SCC Clocking Strategies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tony:

	I currently have approved a default clock strategy for PICO that
specifies Port 3 in the Tymsync mode will expect external I/O clocking.
In the HDLC mode Port 3 will continue to output the 9600 baud clock for
the benefit of all existing customers who depend on the default clocking
for their TII links in the HDLC mode.  This should resolve satisfactorily
the problem HKSBC experiences with it's remote TII Tymsync connections
to PICO.  Additionally, the Tymsync performance on PICO has been improved
to facilitate the 9600 baud links.
