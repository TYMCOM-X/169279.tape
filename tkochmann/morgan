Hywell:

	I have a couple of things for you to look into with
regards to your problem(s).  First, I noticed that the Tymfile
NAN.M parameters all specify XTL (crystal oscillator) as the
source for the transmit clock line source.  Please change this
to TRC for all of the lines that have external clocks.  As a matter
of fact this field can always be left to specify TRC.

	Second, I noticed just an enormous amount of receive
aborts on the PICO.  Typically these are associated with an
overloaded neighbor experiencing transmit underruns which send
aborts out to let the neighbor know to throw out the record that
was being received.  Typically these can be eliminated by reducing
the number of lines on the neighbor machine's motherboard or the
baud rates.

	I suggest bringing up two PICOs  as 2211 and 2212 to switcher
2210 and establishing an error free link between these.  You can load
throughput hosts in 2211 and 2212 and build traffic across the links
to evaluate the quality.  Once the network links are clean then load
the SDLC code into the PICOs and bring up the SDLC background test
and establish the SDLC can run clean, then reconnect the FEP and rerun
the customer application.

	I'll be in Irvine at Staging through Thursday night but I can
support you from down there as you need it.  Also, Danny Fang in our
office may prove instrumental when you bring the customer back up
as he is the SDLC support person.
