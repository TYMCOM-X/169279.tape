                                  1.1  SYMS PROPOSAL


        An integrated WAN/LAN "subnetworking environment" linked to  the Tymnet
        PDN  was presented  to SYMS.   The  network is  to consist  of  two (2)
        Pegasus  Series  18 systems  complete  with P-LAN,  S-LAN  and  TSI WAN
        components.   The S-18  systems will  interface to  22  smaller Eclipse
        (Spirit 7.0)  systems via  Tymnet proper.  All  Tymnet nodes  were dead
        ended off of the network.  The 2 Pegasus machines are to be  9.6K lines
        to Tymnet and the 24  remote stations nonstandard 2.4K lines.   An X.25
        DCE interface  will reside in  a Tymnet ISIS  node connected to  a GECC
        X.25 DTE for credit approvals.  Tymnet traffic will be comprised  of of
        short bursty  transactions during  business hours  and batch  type jobs
        after hours.   We suggest  that SYMS  acquire one  more leased  line to
        facilitate increased  stability in their  network environment.   It was
        also noted that  a TMCS account  be set up  for the Betatest  period to
        help evaluate and debug the applications.






                                     1.2  SCHEDULE


        An aggressive installation schedule was mapped out which specifies that
        the first install occur Sept. 6, 1988 in Secaucus, N.J.  and  the final
        by Nov. 20, 1988 in Southfield, MI.  The initial goal will be  to bring
        up  the Microdata  equipment.   Tymnet networking  will  be implemented
        after the Microdata installs.

                                     1.3  TRAINING


        NTS proposed having  the FSC send  a 3 member team  to NTS in  San Jose
        after the  Microdata bases  have been  installed approximately  2 weeks
        prior to installing the Tymnet TSI application.  The team  will ideally
        consist of a  Tymnet experienced FE, a  Microdata experienced FE  and a
        software oriented CC which will be responsible to bring up the customer
        application  (MBASE) to  the Spirit.   NTS requires  an upgrade  of the
        current Spirit  tower and TSI  board set along  with a complete  set of
        technical documentation  and programming manuals  for the  Spirit.  NTS
        will write a SLTSI slot exerciser to exercise the circuitry between the
        TSI and the Spirit interface which will probably require some expertise
        from Microdata  resources to  complete the test  properly.  TTE  in San
        Jose will have the standalone  TSI board set (PICO) which  will provide
        TTE a certain level of  proficiency using the TSI debugging  tools.  It
        may prove to be more appropriate to have Microdata provide FSC with any
        subsequent Spirit/TSI training.






                               1.4  BUG/FAILURE STRATEGY


        FSC will "hostage" all spares for the Beatest sites.   Suspect hardware
        will  be  returned to  CSC  Engineering in  Irvine  for  specific fault
        isolation/identification.  Software anomalies should be flagged  by the
        CCs and escalated via normal Tymnet procedures.






                                    1.5  CFB SYSTEM


        There  is  no  implemented  system  for  FSC  Engineers  to  access and
        reference ECO,  FCO and  field bulletins  for Microdata  equipment.  It
        would be  appropriate to begin  to houseclean the  Tymnet CFBs  and add
        Microdata references to the system.  It might be desirable  to actually
        set up a  parallel CFB program  keeping the Tymnet  communication field
        bulletins separate from the Microdata bulletins (ie on  systems 55/56).
        The implementation of the Microdata CFBs would introduce  the Microdata
        trained FEs to the  Tymnet format and the  Tymnet FEs would be  able to
        reference Microdata equipment.  Computer Systems Product  Support would
        have to provide  a complete set of  FCOs and field bulletins  which NTS
        can  input.   The  bulletins should  present  information  pertinent to
        equipment switch settings, rev levels, cables, etc.

                                1.6  PROJECT RESOURCES


        The SYMS project is scheduled over the same time period as the ANZ PICO
        project.  Hardware  availability should be  coordinated to  prevent any
        contention of critical components for either project.

        Al Hargadon will follow up with finalized install dates and scheduling.
        Bill Scott will  provide the resources to  upgrade the NTS  lab machine
        with current level Spirit and TSI versions.






                                   1.7  PRESENTATION


        The  2  day project  report  and  planning session  in  New  Jersey was
        essentially divided into day 1 for the Microdata presentation of P-LAN,
        S-LAN  and  Version 7.0  upgrades/functions.   Day 2  was  primarily an
        introduction to the Tymnet  resources and demonstration concluded  by a
        question and answer session and a recap of the total desired end result
        for SYMS.






                                    1.8  EVALUATON


        The application proposed should present no major problems to the Tymnet
        scheme of things.   Two of the  TSI board sets  will utilize all  4 I/O
        ports for networking and there are still unresolved bugs in the the IOC
        firmware.  Dennis  Ernst has promptly  (and timely) provided  a revised
        version of TSI  firmware for evaluation in  our lab as of  Tuesday June
        14, 1988.  NTS requires the board  set from CSC as soon as  possible to
        "shake the new code down".

        NTS has  already acquired  a range of  node and  host numbers  for Bill
        Scott  to  use   in  Bubbnet  for   testing  and  requested   a  common
        userdirectory on (TSI:39).  Bill  will have access to gateway  267 from
        Bubbnet to NTSnet and the  username BILLS in the NTS  network.  Testing
        can be started  today if TSI boards  are available and the  AMS ES-1800
        emulator in service for PICO and TURBO is available for immediate debug
        if needed.   I have already  blocked out the  SLTSI exerciser  and will
        continue work on it just as  if the TSI/Spirit was available to  run on
        to reduce lag time when it is actually brought up.

                                   1.9  X.25/TYMNET


        GECC will need to provide the Tymnet representatives with  specific DTE
        configuration  parameters  to prepare  the  Tymnet DCE  slot  for their
        interface.  This still needs  to be coordinated.  Tymnet PI  also needs
        to be  advised of the  locations and schedules  to reconfigure  the PDN
        nodes for the project.
