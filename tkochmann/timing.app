-----------------------------------------------------------------------

           Timing studies and analysis have been completed on eight
           different Engine configurations beginning with the MAC-I
           and ending with the CPU-III operating at 12 MHZ.  Since
           there is a considerable range of basic CPU power available, 
           I would suggest marketing, network engineering, and development
           personnel familiarize themselves with these documents.

           Reference tables are included drawing comparisons between
           relative CPU power of the various systems.  You will note
           modest improvements in system performance until the introduction
           of the MAC-III and substantial gains thereafter.

           The CPU-III/MAC-III combination operating at 12 MHZ clock rate
           is not available for production as of this date, but will
           provide for three times the power of the current MAC-II dynamic
           memory systems.

                      DIVERGENCE OF INSTRUCTION POWER

        With the design of MACIII memory system, some peculiarities surfaced
        where relative power increases were asymmetrical.  Ratings are JPPU.

        The following set depicts a divergence between the LOAD fullword using
        a simple Load instruction vs. Load Multiple register 15 reference.
        The same phenomenon did not occur with the equivalent store functions.

        The set below indicates a divergence between the Load Multiple
        and Store Multiple combination vs. the Copy instruction.  All
        instructions involve 64 byte data transfers.  Ratings are JPPU.

        TYMNET ENGINE TIMING LIST DEFINITIONS

        FUNCTION - lists  the instruction mnemonic, instruction format
        type, and parameters peculiar  to the instruction being timed.

        e.g.  LM   RX1 REG 0    Load Multiple, RX1 format, 64 bytes
              WD   RX3 T/O      I/O instruction Timed Out

        LOOP TIMING -  the basic time to execute the test loop without
        an actual instruction inserted into the timing loop.  This forms
        the basis for establishing all other timings.

        MACHINE RATING - this rating is based on the JPPU rating described
        below.  It reflects the rate of transfer ability to move one byte of
        data from one memory location to another memory location via the
        lowest common denominator instruction set.  i.e.  Load/Store Byte.
        This provides us with a "horsepower" equivalent which can be used
        to determine relative power variations of different machines.
        e.g.  In relative terms, a machine rating of 45.45 would basically be
              2.536 times as as powerful as a machine rating of 17.92

        TIMING - average time stated in microseconds to execute the
        instruction.  This is averaged over the specified instruction sample
        rate.  Where the instruction sample rate is 180 seconds, the
        instruction loop is run for 180 seconds and calculations derived over
        this time period.  Refer to instruction calculation definitions for
        details.

        MIPS - million instructions per second is derived from the instruction
        timing where one microsecond instruction timing is equivalent to one
        MIP.

        JPPU -  Jonas's Processing Power Unit is a rating system designed to
        reflect the ability to do work.  The JPPU factor is a unit of power
        equal to moving 10,000 bytes of data from one memory location to
        another memory location within one second.

        e.g.  A JPPU rating of 106.56 indicates this instruction is capable
              of moving data internally at a rate of 1,065,600 bytes per
              second.

        The JPPU for a single phase instruction such as the Load RX2 takes
        into account a 4 byte transfer and one half transfer cycle in
        such a manner that if combined with a Store RX2, the relative power
        is the approximate average of the two.

        e.g.  If Load RX2 JPPU = 200
              & Store RX2 JPPU = 185

              The effective JPPU is:  (200+185)/2= 192.5
              192.5 x 10,000 = 1,925,000 bytes/second transfer capability








        RAW DATA - this column simply reflects test loop counts achieved
        during test execution over the period of time indicated in the sample
        rate.  This is only used for verification purposes.

        TOTAL AVERAGE MIPS - the average million instructions per second
        derived from total instruction time which reflects all instructions
        executed and timed.  This figure is used for verification purposes
        and is not intended to reflect true machine power since it includes
        duplicate and worst case timings.

        TOTAL INSTR TIME - total instruction  time is simply the addition
        of all instruction execution times and used for verification purposes.
        It is not intended to reflect true machine power since it includes
        duplicate and worst case timings.

        SELECTED TIMING STATISTICS - these timing statistics reflect true
        timings based on instruction format type.  Instructions marked with a
        (+) have been excluded for reasons of being redundant, special 
        application, or not normally utilized in the manner tested.

                TOTAL TIME - addition of all instruction timings for the
                specified instruction format.

                AVERAGE TIME - average time derived by dividing the total
                time by the number of instructions included in total time
                for the specified instruction format.

                TOTAL MIPS - addition of all instruction mips for the 
                specified instruction format.

                AVERAGE MIPS - average mips derived by dividing the total
                mips by the number of instructions included in total mips
                for the specified instruction format.









        TYMNET ENGINE INSTRUCTION TIMING CALCULATIONS


        Tymnet Engine Instruction Timing Calculations as implemented in
        the "TIMING.NAD" program are basically accomplished in the manner
        specified below.  The COPY, ARAND, and CKSUM instructions are
        calculated in the same manner, but with additional timing adjustments
        since execution of these instructions will destroy register setup
        contents.  The timing must be accomplished with no interrupts 
        occurring other than the special timing interrupt which in this
        example is set for 180 second intervals.  A special timing interrupt
        PC board must be installed on the Engine backplane along with a
        minor strap option on the multifunction card to allow proper
        operation of the special interrupter.


        A constant Timing Loop is established and timed consisting of:

        TLOOP   JALR    R14,R15
                AM      R11,CYCLES
                JNBS    TLOOP

        The JALR    R14,R15 always returns via a JR R14

        R15 is modified to allow insertion of each instruction being
        timed into the basic loop.  Timing is then calculated and adjusted
        to remove the basic loop timing.

        After the specified RATE which in this case is 180 seconds, an 
        interrupt occurs and timing calculated.








        FIND CYCLES PER SECOND
        Multiply Raw CYCLE count by 10 to facilitate rounding by 0.5
        Divide result by RATE (180)
        Add 5 to result
        Divide result by 10 to obtain raw cycles per second

        FIND AVERAGE TIME/CYCLE TO THE 12TH POWER
        Divide 1,000,000,000,000 by raw cycles per second obtained above
        Subtract basic loop time (in picoseconds) from quotient
