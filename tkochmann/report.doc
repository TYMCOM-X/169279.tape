        3M REPORT                                                March 31, 1988






                                    1 -  3M REPORT







                                     1.1  OVERVIEW


                  The  3M store-and-forward  switch seems  to be  an attractive
        package  which   may  "mesh"  quite   well  with  the   Tymnet  Network
        environment.  The 3M switch has  a CCITT X.25 option which  permits the
        transfer of fac-simile documents via either V.24 or V.35 connections at
        line speeds of up to 56K bps.  The connection to the 3M switch from the
        Tymnet  node  would  be  a  direct  X.21  bis  utilizing  standard DB25
        subminature or MR-34  connectors.  There is  NO PAD between  the Tymnet
        DCE and  the 3M  DTE.  Connection is  direct synchronous,  full duplex,
        time-muxed.  The 3M interface supports up to eight virtual simultaneous
        circuits.   Default  packet   size  equals  128  bytes/packet   and  is
        advertised to go up to 1024 bytes/packet.  The X.25 link level protocol
        is  implemented  through  a  Western  Digital  WD2511  packet switching
        controller.  The hardware and software supporting the X.25 interface is
        resident on Motorola 68000 microprocessor based modules.






                              1.2  CHARACTER TO FACSIMILE


             The  3M switch  has  character (8-bit)  to  facsimile capabilities
        which may  be invoked  with the X.25  packet switching  which logically
        transmits ACSII data through  the network and converts to  facsimile at
        the destination(s).  Any FaxXchange may broadcast to up to 99 3M nodes.
        Each  FaxXchange is  assigned a  node number  which prefixes  the phone
        number associated  with the machine.   Although a destination  node may
        transmit  a document  to  multiple fax  machines,  only one  copy  of a
        document is transmitted via X.25.








        1                                         3M FaxXchange **Preliminary**
        3M REPORT                                                March 31, 1988


                                 1.3  X.25 COMPLIANCE


             The X.25 protocol complies with 1980 CCITT  recommendations, LAPB.
        The 3M  X.25 option  supports various  optional user  facilities which,
        when introduced to the  PDN environment where multiple devices  will be
        encountered,  will prove  to be  most efficacious.   Examples  would be
        facilities  such  as  flow  control  negotiation,  packet  window  size
        negotiation,  packet  size   negotiation  and  even   throughput  class
        negotiation.






                               1.4  ADDITIONAL FEATURES


             Additionally,  the  3M  FaxXchange  offers  some  other attractive
        capabilities.   It is  compatible with  CCITT G1,  G2 and  G3 protocols
        permitting facsimile exchanges with a wide range of  existing machines.
        Each  machine  can  be  configured for  up  to  8  telephone  ports for
        facsimile broadcast/reception.  When busy signals are detected  the box
        is  programmed  to  step  through  time  intervals  and   redial  until
        successful transmission is executed.  Transmission of documents  may be
        immediate or  time delayed at  predetermined times (ie  during off-peak
        hours).   The   character  to  facsimile   feature  would   permit  the
        transmission of files from terminals or PCs to "broadcast" to  fax type
        devices.   This  asynchronous  port operates  from  300  to  9600 baud,
        expects 8-bit, no  parity, 1 stop bit  and XON/XOFF flow  control.  The
        FaxXchange  provides password  security, user  mailboxes and  batch job
        features.

             An Administration  (local) async  port is  provided for  access to
        system utilities.  Disk maintenance must be manually performed via this
        port.  Accounting data is also retrieved via this channel.  The port is
        also  used  for  Error  Log  file  recovery,  Line  Utilization Summary
        Reports, soft reconfiguration of system  ports (ie X.25 set to  TX, RX,
        TX/RX or  unavailable) and  analysis of fax  traffic.  This  port could
        quite easily be hardwired to a Tymnet Async Addressable port for Netcon
        or technical support network access.

             Another interesting marketing possibility may exist as there is an
        "unannounced" IBM TIF that  3M has developed for the  FaxXchange.  When
        available it would probably be extremely interesting to present our own
        HIF code to  their TIF code  to again permit  network access as  in the
        X.25 environment.

        3M REPORT                                                March 31, 1988


                                  1.5  DOCUMENTATION


             Specifications for the FaxXchange  were requested while at  the 3M
        facility and verbally agreed to be sent but none have been  received as
        of this time.  I had hoped to see EIA electrical specs, a complete X.25
        specification  and  user  document,  a  complete   user  Administration
        document,  lists  of PC  programs  existing to  manage  accounting data
        retrieved from the Admin port and a full list of diagnostic capabilites
        (including  disk   utilities).   Without  such   documentation  product
        evaluation  becomes extraordinarly  difficult.  A  list of  all default
        hardware/software straps and options was also requested and expected to
        be in the user manual.  Knowledge of the signals presented and expected
        at  the physical  level  is also  fundamental.   Bob Johnson  of  3M is
        pursuing the documentation at this time.






                                    1.6  EVALUATION


             I  suggest that  the 3M  FaxXchange appears  to be  worth thorough
        evaluation.   In addition  to having  the requested  documentation made
        available, we require two FaxXchange plus facsimile machines and the PC
        software available to manage/monitor the machines.  The machines should
        be made available at the Tymnet  facility in San Jose as this  is where
        we have our broadest base of technical expertise available not  only to
        evaluate the  product but  also to  expeditiously "debug"  any problems
        that may arise in testing.

             Performance benchmarks  should be made  with the 3M  box excluding
        the Tymnet equipment and then again including Tymnet.  Line  speeds and
        bandwidth  utilization  should be  measured  and compared  with  the 3M
        Administration utilization  statistics.  Line  speeds and  packet sizes
        shall be stepped through various configurations.  Bandwidth utilization
        should be  defined as a  function with a  limit and derivatives  of the
        function   differentiated   to  provide   accurate   interpretation  of
        laboratory test data.   Single vs multiple virtual  channel performance
        shall be measured as well.

             Error detection/recovery requires  lab analysis.  Errors  shall be
        injected on the physical level, frame abortions generated and detected,
        protocol violations or errors generated and detected.  Tymnet debugging
        and monitor  tools shall be  invoked during the  error/recovery periods
        and sessions recorded.  Concurrently the 3M Administrative  tools shall
        likewise  be  invoked and  recorded.   The two  shall  be  compared and
        evaluated  for accuracy  and detail.   The resultant  data needs  to be
        interpreted and  points of congruence  and/or incongruence  noted.  Any
        concerns that may exist regarding accounting/billing information should


        3                                         3M FaxXchange **Preliminary**
        3M REPORT                                                March 31, 1988


        also  be  aired out  and  evaluated during  the  testing.   Tymnet X.25
        certification could also be completed during the same period.

             Subjecting  the  3M  FaxXchange  to  such  laboratory  environment
        controlled testing should prove to be beneficial to both 3M  and Tymnet
        interests.  The testing would be useful for determination of whether or
        not the 3M package is a good fit for Tymnet  worth pursuing further and
        would provide necessary information  to help support the product  if we
        actually decide to engage in this venture.
