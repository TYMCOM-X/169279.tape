Gary:

	Regarding the HKSBC PICOs we discussed on the phone, can you send
them all to NTS for upgrades to return to the field.  As I recall you have
no kits even available to perform upgrades.  We are entertaining the idea
of going to Australia and upgrading the down rev field units remotely
rather than ship them all around the world again.  Not only will this rev
up the machines you have in house but we will also get a first hand look
at the kinds of upgrades needed in the field.  

	Send the units all to:

	MDD NSC
	2560 N. 1st St.
	San Jose, Calif. 95161-9019
	Mail Stop F-21
	Attention: T.C.Kochmann

Regards;

Tim
