SCOPE.
------
    The idea of this document is to briefly describe the function of the
    battery backup unit, it`s purpose, brief description, installation,
    test procedure, manufacturing procedure and operating specifications.
    It is not a official Tymshare document and is intended for use by
    Tymshare personnel in compiling documentation to support the
    product mentioned herein.
    The following Tymshare documents are available:










PURPOSE
-------
1/. To backup the main Engine/mini-Engine, one MB semiconductor memory
    board. (approx two hours of backup for a fully charged battery,
    provided twelve hours charge time before loss of power).
2/. To backup the micro-Engine. In this configuration the charger/power
    supply will both float the 12volt 4.5amphour battery and supply the
    micro-Engine, with a regulated 5volt output. In the event of a power
    failure, the battery will power the 5volt regulator. (approx three to
    four hours of backup should be available from a fully charged unit
    provided twelve hours of charge before loss of power).
DESCRIPTION
-----------
    The unit has been designed to function on a/c power sources of
    115volts60Hertz and 230volts50Hertz, with only minor changes
    required to switch  from one supply to the other.
    The unit has detachable power cord, that fits into a standard I.E.C.
    connector. The hot side is fused (1amp), and switched (S1).
    A terminal strip has been used to make the change over from one a/c
    source to the other easy (fan has to be changed to match the a/c source).
    The transformer (T1) is a dual primary type, with a secondary rating
    of 16volts R.M.S. @3.5amps.   	
    The p.c.b. (A1) contains the charger which supplies a nominal output
    of between 13.5 to 13.8volts. This output is used, to float charge the
    battery, to supply a 12volt output for the Engine and to power the
    5volt regulator for the micro-Engine.
    The a/c input from the secondary of the transformer is connected to
    a 2pin Molex connector (J1). The 6pin Molex (J2) is the outputs of the 
    board to the battery and rear panel connectors. All 3 outputs have
    been fused for safety.
    The battery is a 12volt 4.5amphour gell cell type which has a lifetime
    of approx 100 to 150 full discharges, or a float of four years.
    The interconnect wiring is for the most part 16 A.W.G., Molex connecters
    have been used for j1 and j2 and insulated quick/connect/disconnect 
    terminals are used to make connection with the power input connector
    ,switch, battery etc.
    There are two outputs from the battery backup unit, the micro-Engine
    output is a two pin Molex connector with 5volts on pin1 and 5volt
    return on pin2, the Engine/mini Engine output is the four pin Molex
    connector with a unregulated 12volts on pin1 and the return on pin
    4.
    
  INSTALLATION
  ------------
    MICRO-Engine. The battery backup unit has been designed to be a desk-
    unit, similar to the micro Engine philosophy 
    To install the battery backup on a micro Engine perform the following
    steps.
    1/. Remove the memory board P/N (430173-001) from the micro Engine.
    2/. Remove the following jumpers on the memory board:W2,W3,W4,W5,
    W6,W7,W8,W9,W10,W12,W13,W14,and W15.
    3/. Install the cable assembly P/N (160129-001) between the memory
    board and the rear panel when reassembling the micro Engine.
    4/. Install the cable assembly P/N (160172-001) between the micro
    Engine connector labeled "BATTERY POWER" and the connector labeled
    "MICRO Engine" on the battery backup unit. Both ends are two pin
    Molex connectors and are polarized for correct insertion.
    5/. Install power connectors in suitable power outlets, and power
    up battery backup unit and micro Engine.
    The battery backup unit should now be installed.

    Engine/MINI Engine. The battery backup unit has been designed to
    use ears so that it can be mounted into a standard Engine or mini
    Engine rack.
    To install a battery backup unit on a Engine or mini Engine perform
    the following steps:
    1/. Mount the battery backup unit in a convient slot on the Engine/
    mini Engine mounting rails, either at the front or rear of the machine.
    2/. The semiconductor memory board P/N (430147-003) has to be modified
    to accept the battery backup unit, with the following steps:
    a). Remove from the memory board the NiCd battery pack B1 P/N (64002-001).
    b). Remove diode CR9 P/N (350006-001).
    c). Tag assembly with P/N (540003-001) to show that this assembly has 
    been modified to accept a battery backup unit.
    3/. Install cable assembly P/N (160173-001) between the battery backup
    unit connector labeled "Engine/MINI Engine" (four pin Molex) and the
    semiconductor memory board,  connector "J1" (50 pin header).
    both ends of the cable are polarized so there should be no chance of 
    incorrect installation.
    4/. Install  the battery backup`s power cable into a unswitched
    outlet within the Engine (by unswitched I mean a power outlet that
    is not controlled by the console key switch), or a suitable wall
    outlet.
    5/. Power up the battery backup unit and Engine.
    The battery backup system is now installed.
CAUTION!!
---------
    It is possible to get into a situation in which D.C. power is
    available on the output  connectors, (this will be indicated by
    the power LED being lit) when no ac power is being supplied.
    Both outputs are fused, but when working on the memory board in
    the micro Engine or semiconductor memory board in the Engine
    ,the battery backup unit should be switched off, or care should
    be exercised when working on these boards.
MANUFACTURING TEST PROCEDURE
-----------------------------
    To test the integrity of the battery backup unit the following
    test equipment is required:
         a). Digital volt meter.
         b). Variable power supply.
         c). Fully charged gell cell Tymshare P/N (390020-001).
         d). Test jig (contain's item "c" and the transformer, wiring etc.
    The test philosophy that I think works best is to test the battery backup
    unit in two stages as follows:
         1/. The printed circuit assembly P/N (430206-001).
         2/. The battery backup system in a real environment.
    To test the printed circuit assembly perform the following steps:
    1/. Install the board to be tested (hereafter called B.U.T.for board 
    under test) into the test jig, connect the two pin Molex plug into
    J1.Connect the six pin Molex plug into J2, install the power cord into
    the test jig and a suitable power outlet, switch on the test jig.
    2/.Using the d.v.m. take the following measurement by connecting the
    common of the d.v.m. to pin 6 of J2 and the other lead of the
    d.v.m. to the following points:
POINT ON  B.U.T. |  D.V.M. SCALE  | VOLTAGE READING | NOTES
========================================================================
+ of C1          | d.c. volts 200 | approx 22.5volt | voltage across rectifier
                 |                |                 | bridge.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ of battery B1  | d.c. volts 20  | set voltage from| adjust pot R16
                 |                | 13.5 to 13.6    |
------------------------------------------------------------------------
pin 2 of J2      | d.c. volts 20  | approx 12.2volt | output to Engine
------------------------------------------------------------------------
pin 3 of J2      | d.c. volts 20  | set voltage from| adjust pot R17
                 |                | 5.1 to 5.2volts |   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This concludes calibration, leave common or the d.v.m. on pin 6.
    3/. To test the battery low voltage disconnect circuit perform
    the following steps:
    a). Remove connector J2 and fuse F1.
    b). Disconnect power cord and install variable power supply to 
    test jig. Connect the negative terminal of the p.s.u. to pin 
    5 of j2, connect the postive terminal of the variable power supply
    to the cathodes of "CR8 & CR7", connect the postive of the d.v.m.
    to pin 1 of "U2".
    c). Power up the power supply and adjust the voltage to approx
    13.5 volts, remove the connection from "CR7". The relay should 
    be closed, this can be checked by monitoring the 5 volts on pin
    pin 3 of J2.
    d). Reduce the power supply voltage, at approx 10 volts the relay
    should release this again should be checked by monitoring the 
    5 volt output.
    If the board passes these last tests reinstall F1, and return
    board to production to be installed into a battery backup
    unit.
    To test the battery backup unit as system perform the following
    steps:
    1/. First install the battery backup unit into a test system
    as described in the installation section of this document.
    2/. Bring up system (Engine/ mini Engine or micro Engine
    whichever the order calls for) and check it operates correctly,
    by loading code into the machine and checking it goes through a
    power down power up cycle successfully.
    3/. To insure the battery is fully charged maintain the battery backup
    unit under power for a period of 12 hours.
    4/. Power down total system including battery backup unit, (to
    do this either unplug the unit or power it from a switched 
    power socket do not switch the unit off) and leave it powered
    down for 2 hours Engine/mini Engine or 4 hours for the micro
    Engine.
    5/. Power up the system after the time prescribed above and
    insure the system restarts.
    This concludes the testing of the battery backup system, before
    shipping the unit recharge the battery and then switch the unit
    off.
MANUFACTURING ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES
---------------------------------
    There is not that much to this section of the document as
    Tymshare documentation covers this in detail. However there
    are two parts on the p.c.b. that should not be placed into
    a cleaning solution bath, they are the relay "K1"and the
    capacitor "C1".

MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES
----------------------
    There should be no need for periodic maintenance of the battery
    backup unit. The battery should be good for 100 to 150 full
    discharges or four years of float life. Probably the best method
    of checking the state of the battery is about every six months
    to totally power the system down for the prescribed time and 
    check that the memory retains the data.
