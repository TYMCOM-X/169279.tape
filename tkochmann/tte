	Please construct a list of all TTE classes with dates (approximate)
that you have attended and indicate any course(s) you feel you would
benefit from by the end of July so that I can schedule classes for the
group members.  

	Starting in Sept when the summer crunch has settled down and we
hopefully have a full complement of personnel I will be scheduling in-
house workshops for the group.  I expect to have a group status meeting
every first and third Friday (informal) of the month.  Be prepared to
discuss topics for the workshops and target specific areas that need
to be addressed (technical only).  The first workshop will be Sept 9
at 2:00 PM.  That gives everyone a chance to get back from lunch and
wrap up any loose ends for the week.  The topic will be Telco trouble-
shooting and we will bring in line test equipment for lab work.  The
first workshop will target working with Telco on leased lines and will
include BOC trouble procedures, phone numbers and key specialist.  Jim
Stein will provide his expertise to drive the first session.  The next
next workshop will consist of Async dial-up troubleshooting and perhaps
we could then have a troubleshooting workshop specific to Payment Systems.

	These workshops are for NTS personnel only and will be
oriented towards the specific needs of the individuals within
our group.
