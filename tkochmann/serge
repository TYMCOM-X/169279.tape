Serge:

	Sam and Nils from Irvine have relayed to me that you are seeing
errors on the PICO machines that sound very much like errors encountered
on version 32 of DSIO.  What version do you currently run?  Have you
tried the released version from Engdiag directories and if so with what
results?  Manufacturing here was given a shipping deviation authorization
for the PICO with version 32 DSIO last November 1988.  I am quite
concerned for the quality of the boxes you are receiving as I have had
more than a little "fun" trying to help your UK people deploy the box
in England.

	Drop me a line as you like or call me at 408-922-7493 between
3:00PM and 5:00PM London time any day this week to discuss the situation.

Best Regards;

Tim
