        Tracking/Analysis/Reporting System
     
===========================================================================
     
        There is an effort at this time to collect input from "key" players  
in the "great troubled network woes system of things" responsible for 
providing tools to be used not only for problem resolutions but for reporting   
and tracking as well.  "Key" players are such people as Don Murtaugh, 
Dan Lasater, Peter O'Harrow and a few others.  Two meetings have been 
coordinated by Ethel James to stimulate input and interaction between these
players.  As all are painfully aware of we simply have not had resources to
justify delegating a representative from our group to attend with all of the    
projects we all are supporting this week while taking care of the hotter field  
escalations which we received no break from again.  I do feel that this is a    
worthwhile effort however and I suspect that our group could/should provide
much of the input for this effort therefore I am directing all HTS members to   
submit their individual thoughts on the existing system for reporting,
analyzing, tracking and follow up of problems and then their suggestions   
for what they feel may help to reenforce the system.   
     
        I am not looking for generic suggestions of improved diagnostics!    
I am looking for specifics such as:
     
        Establish a chain of Regional Technical Support Engineers  
        directly responsible to NSC/NTD/NTS who are not subjugate  
        to the currents and eddies of a CSC-Microdata oriented
        Field Service organization in flux.    
     
        Establish an installation team which will review all  
        scheduled projects.  This team will watchdog conformance   
        to configuation guidelines, proper site preparation,  
        actual bringup of application interfaces which often  
        occurs long after the initial hardware installation.  
        Rsponsibiities will also include watchdoging Customer 
        Service follow up for customer satisifaction which will    
        include performance as well as reliability. 
     
        Establish a comprehensive "hot" spares lab in NTS which    
        will be comprised of more than one each of all hardware    
        deployed and scheduled for deployment in the field which   
        could be pulled and shipped to any field office or customer
        site at a moment's notice.  This is extremely urgent as the
        customers we deal with at our level have usually been 
        experiencing difficulties for some period of time and we   
        often do not have the luxury of waiting for FSC to provide 
        what may or may not be "known good" hardware which may or  
        may not be up to current ECO levels.   
     
        Establish an NTD/NTS internship where each member of HTS is
        required to work with a Hardware Development Engineer on   
        any given project no less than 4 weeks continuously no
        less than once every two years.   
     
        Establish an NTS/NTD internship where each member of NTD   
        Product Support is required to work no less than 4 weeks   
        uninterrupted with an HTS support engineer no less than    
        once every two years.   
     
        A mandatory policy that each teaching member of TTE put    
        in no less than 4 weeks service in either STS or NTS as    
        appropriate to their specialties each year prior to   
        presenting any classes to field and customer representatives.   
     
        Continue NTD/NTS in-house workshops for FSC field engineers,    
        MDISI field engineers, NSC Sales representatives and NSC   
        Customers Service Representatives such as the Nov. 6th
        three day workshop for the CS's next month. 
     
        Confidential meetings with STS/NTS and Marketing which clearly  
        map out Marketing and Sales targets to enable the support  
        organizations to budget time and resources for OEM equipment    
        evaluation, deployment and support.    
     
        Confidential meetings with STS/NTS and NTD which clearly map    
        out all products scheduled for release over the next year so    
        that the support groups can budget and anticipate for the  
        upcoming year.
     
        Reenforce the established FSC hardware escalation procedures    
        by directing all FSC trouble calls and tickets to be pathed
        through the regional technical support personnel.  Perhaps no   
        calls should be accepted from FSC if the regional support  
        groups have not investigated the problems themselves and   
        failing to find resolution then contact the Operations Technical
        Support staff (LLoyd Claytor, Randy Ferguson, Bill Wu) who, if  
        also unable to resolve the problem, could at least collate all  
        relative information and a complete history of the problem.  This    
        in itself may aid to reduce the size of some black holes in the 
        system.  
     
        Establish some kind of education and coordination scheme for    
        Network Engineering, Order Entry and Project Implementation
        groups to permit cross-checking of one another and further 
        reduce the dimension of existing back holes at corporate H.Q.   
     
        Please formulate your responses and return them to me no   
later than Friday, 20-Oct-89 upon which time we will have a group
review of the suggestions.  As we will quite probably lose several    
of our people to the field in the next month (Bunyan to Vienna, McKinsey   
to Irvine, Richards to Irvine, Stein to Compact XL installations, Schmidt  
to Turbo installations, Shepherd to Hong Kong) this will serve as a group  
project and status meeting as well.  Converge on conference room F2-655    
at 3:00 PM, Friday, 20-Oct-89.
