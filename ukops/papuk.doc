       I. INTRODUCTION
          ------------


               The Paper Ticket System Program, located on host 56, is
          a program designed to track current Tymnet network faults on
          created tickets and keep these faults, once resolved, in a
          historical database for future reference.  Currently, there
          is a document located on user UKOPS on host 56 called file
          Paper.Doc.  That document was conceived to show the various
          commands available on the program and to teach how to use
          them.

               The following document was written as a complimentary
          document to Paper.Doc.  While the former document will talk
          about how to do something, such as setting a ticket's
          severity, this document will tell the user what criteria
          should determine which severity a ticket should be.  While
          the former document will explain the mechanics of how to
          defer a ticket, this document will explain when to defer
          one.  It also talks about various tasks, such as how often
          to look at tickets, what a chronic ticket is and other
          subjects.  By using this document, it will help make more
          uniform how each technician performs his daily tasks.

               It is important that the user be familiar with
          Paper.Doc and use it with this document for the best
          results.

      II. OPENING TROUBLE TICKETS
          -----------------------

               The purpose of this section is to establish a standard
          that produces uniformity in trouble ticket fault reporting.
          This will describe both the criteria for opening trouble
          tickets and a description of the needed information and how
          to proceed.

               The need for a trouble ticket is reported and/or
          detected in one of two ways:

            1) NMC personnel have identified a possible fault using
               their Tymnet monitoring devices.

            2) Customer has contacted the FRC with a possible problem.

               A trouble ticket is not necessary under the following
          circumstances:

            1) A customer or technical support ask for assistance on a
               problem and specifically indicate that a trouble ticket
               will not be necessary.

            2) An outage is the result of a scheduled event, such as a
               site power outage or project being implemented.

               It will occur from time to time when a customer will
          call the FRC indicating a problem, but not being sure if
          they have caused it.  If this is the case, open a ticket.
          It can be closed later as a CUSTOMER INDUCED problem if
          troubleshooting shows that the customer did indeed cause the
          fault.

               Once it has decided that there is a problem in need of
          tracking, proceed in the following manner:

            1) Review the existing trouble tickets to see if there is
               already a ticket open on the problem.  If so, update
               the person as to the current status and persue as
               normal.

            2) If there is not a ticket open, open one and trouble
               shoot as much as possible before passing to the FRC.

                    It is important that the person check how many
               tickets had been opened on this particular problem in
               the last 30 days by checking for previously open
               tickets.  If it is discovered that two or more have
               been opened in the last 30 days, mark this ticket as a
               CHRONIC PROBLEM in the opening status (see section on
               CHRONIC problems).

            3) The minumum information that should be on the ticket
               is:

                  - Node, host and slot number
                                                                  Page 3


                  - Circuit number if applicable
                  - Site location, contact and phone number
                  - Precise discription of the problem
                  - Exact time the outage began.  This would be either
                    the time the customer called or the time the NMC
                    first detected the problem.
                  - Initial troubleshooting steps taken
                  - Set ticket severity level (see following section).

            d) There will be times when the paper ticket system will
               be unavailable.  During these times, it will be
               necessary for the indiviual to track the outages
               temporarily on paper.  In such cases, be sure to list
               all the same information for both opening tickets and
               statusing tickets on paper.  The information can then
               be added to the system when it comes up either by
               yourself or another indiviual.
                                                                  Page 4


     III. SELECTING A TICKET SEVERITY
          ---------------------------

               Setting the severity of a ticket is extremely
          important.  A ticket's severity will determine the
          following:

            1) In what order the tickets will be persued.

            2) Will the outage be persued on a 24 hour basis.

            3) What the duration of time between each status and each
               escalation will be.

               The following criteria should be used when determining
          the severity of a ticket when opening it:

            1) Severity One - These are tickets that have a severe
               impact on customers business, a loss of production that
               cannot be circumvented.  These would include

                  - Network supervisor failure.
                  - Node failure, meaning a node has crashed or is
                    going down/up repeatedly.
                  - Slot outages of hosts that are unusable and
                    needed, such as a customer slot crash.
                  - Private access port problems.
                  - Lease or dedicated line problems.
                  - T-1 lines, 56kb, and 64 kb line problems.

            2) Severity Two - These tickets are serious problems where
               service is partially interrupted or impaired.  examples
               of these include:

                  - Slots (partially restored).
                  - Internodal links (19.2 speeds and 14.4)
                  - Slot lines (partailly disabled).
                  - Gateways when other are available.

            3) Severity three - These are problems that have a medium
               impact and can be circumvented.  Examples of these
               include:

                  - Slots in which service is restored.
                  - 9.6 internodal links.
                  - Node crashes that come back up on own and does not
                    reoccur for 24 hours.


            4) Severity four - These are tickets were there is little
               impact on network production.

                  - Very low speed internodal line troubles such as
                    4.8 links.
                  - Host end-u{ser problems.

            5) Miscellaneous information - The following rules should
                                                                  Page 5


               be noted on the following when determining severity:

                  - CHRONIC tickets should have the same severity as
                    if it were a normal outage.
                  - WORST NODES/LINES tickets should have the same
                    severity as normal, but should have the time set
                    up for one minute after opening either when the
                    ticket is opened or closed.
                  - PROJECT tickets should be opened if a project is
                    more than 24 hours over due in it's installation
                    and be sent to the field with it's normal severity
                    for the field to persue.
                                                                  Page 6


      IV. REVIEWING OPEN TICKETS
          ----------------------

               It is important that open tickets are reviewed on a
          periodic basis, both for UKNET and GNS.  The procedures in
          this section will insure that every shift examines the open
          tickets to determine what, if any, actions needs to be taken
          and to detect any procedural errors which may have been
          detected and need to be corrected.

            1) Within 15 minutes of the start of a shift, the command
               R COM;MRNRUN.CMD should be run.  This will list the
               districts 102, 123, 59, 76 and 79 along with the 714
               command, which will list all escalations on UKNET and
               GNS, and the 514, which will list all open tickets open
               to BTUK control group.

            2) Examine the output, starting with the 714 and 514
               commands for the following on the tickets listed:

                  - Require direct action from the technician
                  - Require additional support group action
                  - Require status updates (see esscalation section).
                  - Should be placed on monitor, deferred, time set up
                    or closed.
                  - Have procedural errors that need correcting.
                  - Require technical and/or managerial escalations.
                    These ticket types should be brought to the
                    attention of the acting shift head when escalated.

            3) Use the following timeframes for obtaining statuses and
               escalations of problems:

                  - Severity Ones - Status every 2 hours and Escalate
                    every 4 hours.
                  - Severity Two's - Status every 4 hours and escalate
                    very 12 hours.
                  - Severity Three's - Status every 12 hours and
                    escalate every 24 hours.
                  - Severity Four's - Status every 24 hours and
                    escalation can occur at the supervisors
                    discretions.

            4) This process is to be repeated as oftened as required
               or specified by the acting supervissor.
                                                                  Page 7


       V. CHRONIC PROBLEMS
          ----------------

               A Chronic problem is defined as a fault which has
          repeatly occurred on the network over a designated period of
          time.  They are discovered in two basic manners:

            1) A fault has occurred and upon checking previouly opened
               tickets, two or more have been found to have been
               opened on the same problem in the last 30 days.

            2) Review of Worst Node/Link list for the week.

               Once it has been determined that a problem is a chronic
          problem, then it should be persued in the following manner:

            1) Review all of the listed trouble tickets open in the
               ticket system program for the same fault over the last
               30 days.

            2) Status the new ticket with all applicable information,
               including dates and times of previous tickets, ticket
               numbers, and previous resolutions.

            3) Status the new ticket with any troubleshooting
               performed.

            4) Inform the support group working on the problem of the
               history of the problem.

            5) Attach the current ticket's hardcopy to hardcopy of
               previous tickets and give to your supervisor for
               review.

            6) The supervisor or his designated person will make any
               required managerial escalations to bring resolution to
               the problem.
                                                                  Page 8


      VI. STOPPING THE CLOCK ON A TICKET
          ------------------------------

               Stopping the clock on a ticket is the process of
          halting the clock on a ticket which tells the technician how
          long a problem has been persued.  There are two basic ways
          to do it:

            1) Deferring a ticket - This is the process by which the
               technician adds to a ticket the amount of hours the
               ticket does not need to be presued.  These hours will
               be subtracted by the ticket system from the total hours
               a ticket will be shown as opened when you close a
               ticket.

                    For example, if you open a ticket that is open
               from midnight to noon (12 hours) and a technician along
               the way has added 10 hours deferment to a ticket, when
               the ticket is closed, the total ticket time will be
               shown aas 2 hours.

                    A ticket can be deferred when the follwing has
               occurred:

                  - A customer has requested the repair be delayed.
                  - Their is no access to a customer site to work on
                    problem.
                  - The severity does not required immediate dispatch
                    to a site.  For example, a severity 3 ticket does
                    not have to be persued until the am and can have
                    deferment time placed on it if opened at night
                    until the am.

            2) Setting the Time Up - This is the process of simply
               stopping the clock on a ticket.  It can be done using
               the "10" command when entering a status and adjusted
               using the "G" command.  To restart the clock, simply
               reopen the ticket using the "4" command when entering
               the status as to why clock is being restarted.  Unlike
               deferring a ticket, all the total time will be returned
               to the ticket that was not accumulated do to the time
               being set up.

                    Occasions when the time would be set up would be:

                  - Worst Link Tickets - After these tickets are open,
                    time should be set up for one minute after opening
                    ticket time.
                  - Deinstall - Outage occurring due to project
                    deinstall.  Set time up for one minute after
                    ticket open time.
                                                                  Page 9


     VII. CLOSING A TICKET
          ----------------

               It is important to have a standard and guidlines so
          that tickets will be closed in a consistent manner in terms
          of the time the problem was solved, the correct close out
          ocde (COC) and monitoring select tickets befdore closing to
          be sure a problem is solved.  To bring about this situation,
          this section will lay out some common criteria for the
          closing out of tickets.

            1) Closing a ticket.

                    A ticket is to be closed when a problem is
               resolved to the satisfaction of the customer or the NMC
               technician when no customer is involved.  When doing a
               ticket close, three critical items must be watched in
               order to get consistent in how tickets are closed.  The
               are the following:

                 a) Ticket Close Time - This is the time the problem
                    was fixed.  For example, if a node is reloaded,
                    the time should be the time xray indicates the
                    node came back up.  For lines, again the time xray
                    shows it came up.  It should not be the time a
                    customer is called to confirm a problem was fixed
                    or the phone company calls back to say problem was
                    repaired.

                 b) Use the correct Close Out Code (COC) - These are
                    the codes which are set in the ticket header to
                    indicate the reason for the outage.  They are
                    listed below with the following definitions.

                       - NTF/D AND R - No Trouble was Found when
                         checking out the fault or the node was Dumped
                         and Reloaded to bring up into the network.
                         Examples of the COC would include if
                         diagnostics on done on a node and nothing
                         wrong is found or a NMC technician dumps and
                         reloads a node and the dump file show no
                         problems.
                       - Hardware -This COC would cover any fault
                         resolved by replacement of hardware on the
                         node, not including modems for peripherals,
                         which have ther own COC's.
                       - Software - This COC would cover any software
                    error in code, ither node code or software
                         code, that caused the fault.  It would not
                         include any code invovled in a project.
                       - Unknown - No action was taken on this fault
                         and it resolved itself.  This is different
                         from the NTF in which actions are taken, but
                         nothing found.
                       - Customer Induced - Outage due to customer
                         taking some action, such as powering down a
                         site or turning off their equipment.
                                                                 Page 10


                       - Telco Induced - This COC covers any fault
                         which is solved by a fix on phone company
                         equipment.
                       - OEM (Modem, etc...) - Code is for any outage
                         caused by modem problem.
                       - Power Outage at Site - Code is for power
                         outage at site that is not induced by someone
                         at site, such as powering down site for
                         electrical work.
                       - Periferals - Code is for any h/w that is not
                         part of main node h/w.  Items such as tape
                         drives would fall under this COC.
                       - Dead-Ended Node - Code to be used for node
                         down to it's only neighbor to netowrk being
                         off the network.
                       - Project - Code for any outage due to a
                         project.
                       - Async Project - Code for any async project.
                         All other project would fall under COC
                         Project.

                 c) Closing Statuses - Be sure that this final ticket
                    statuses has a specific resolution in it for the
                    problem if one is known.  This will allow another
                    technician who reads the ticket later to easily
                    see how the problem was solved if that information
                    is required.

            2) Placing a Ticket on Monitor before Closing.

                    Sometimes a resolution will occur when the reason
               for the fix is unknown.  A phone company CLEAR WHILE
               TESTING wold be an example fo this instance.  In these
               type of cases, you will want to stop the clock on a
               ticket and MONTIOR it for a specific time fromae to be
               sure the problem is resolved.

                    Use the following criteria when placing a ticket
               on MONITOR:

                 a) A node crashes and the fix is unknown or a
                    techniciaqn is unsure if the fix has the solved
                    the problem.  In this case, place the ticket on
                    MONITOR and watch the problem for a minumum of 2
                    hours.  If no other problems, at that point close
                    the ticket.

                 b) A circuit outage is returned with CLEAR WHILE
                    TESTING or NO PROBLEM FOUND.  In this case,
                    monitor for 2 hours and then close if all is
                    normal.

                 c) A host outage that has a unknown fix should be
                    MONITORED for 24 hours following restoration of
                    service before the ticket is closed.
