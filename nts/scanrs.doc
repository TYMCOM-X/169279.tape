Note on Version 44:
        Version 44 fixes a bug in 43.  Version 43 cannot identify the
Jerusalem-B virus (earlier versions of SCANRES work correctly). 
DO NOT USE version 43.

Notes on Version 43:
        Version 43 now identifies the Alabama Virus.  This virus was
discovered by Ysrael Radai at Hebrew University and forwarded to
us through Dave Chess at IBM.  The virus infects .EXE files and
increases their size by 1560 bytes.  It manipulates the file
allocation table and swaps file names so that files are slowly
lost.
        Additional Version 43 enhancements are:
                - Fix to include EXE file searches for DataCrime II
                - Fix for duplicate reporting when Ashar virus is
            identified

Notes on Version 42:
        Version 42 of SCANRES includes an identifier for the Yankee
Doodle Virus.  This virus was discovered in Vienna by Alexander
Holy at the United Nation's office on Sept 30th.  The virus has
reportedly been transmitted to the U.S. through U.N. employees via
the game - 'Outrun'.  The virus plays the tune - 'Yankee Doodle
Dandy' on the system's speaker 17 hours after an infected program
is loaded.  Both COM and EXE files can be infected, and infected
files grow by 2899 bytes.  No knowledge yet of eventual damage
potential.

Introduction:

        SCANRES, the memory resident version of VIRUSCAN,  prevents
viruses from getting into your system.  It monitors and scans
programs as they are loaded and prevents infected programs from
executing.  It also scans specific areas of the system - the boot
sector, partition table, hidden files, Command Interpreter and
itself, when it is first executed. 
        The memory resident module -- SCANRES.EXE - will identify the
virus strain which has caused the infection in all cases of the
known viruses.  It remains active in your system at all times after
it is loaded.
        SCANRES version 1.0V44 can identify 43 major virus strains
and numerous sub-varieties for each strain.  The 43 viruses include
the ten most common viruses which account for over 95% of all
reported PC infections.  The complete list includes (in order of
most recent appearance):

        - PING PONG-B / FALLING LETTERS BOOT
        - DEN ZUK
        - PING Pong / ITALIAN / BOUNCING DOT
        - VIENNA-B
        - LEHIGH
        - VIENNA / 648 / DOS-62

        - JERUSALEM / 1813
        - SURIV03 
        - SURIV02
        - SURIV01
        - PAKISTANI BRAIN

        It is important to note that existing virus strains can be
grouped and counted differently than the above ordering.  DEN ZUK,
for example has two separate versions.  Likewise, the STONED,
VIENNA, ALAMEDA and JERUSALEM-B viruses have been modified a number
of times. Some researchers would define each of these
modifications, or sub-varieties, as separate viruses.  SCANRES
chooses to group them as the same virus, because the same scan
string can identify each of them.  This is only done if
disinfection requirements for the different sub-varieties are
identical.  If removal procedures differ for different varieties,
then SCANRES will differentiate between them.

        These viruses infect one of the following areas:  The hard
disk partition table; the DOS boot sector of hard disks or
floppies; or one or more executable files within the system.  The
executable files may be operating system programs, system device
drivers, .COM files, .EXE files, overlay files or any other file
which can be loaded into memory and executed.  SCANRES identifies
the area or file that has become infected and indicates the name
of the virus that has infected each area.  
        When an infection is identified, the VIRUSCAN non-resident
system scanner should be used to scan the entire system and
determine the extent of the infection.  If you do not have the
VIRUSCAN non-resident program, it may be downloaded from the
HomeBase BBS at 408 988 4004. 


Operation:

IMPORTANT: First place SCANRES on a write protected floppy prior
to installing it.  This will ensure a valid copy in the event that
the program becomes infected.

        To install SCANRES, place the following line as the FIRST
        entry in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

                        SCANRES

        Then copy the file SCANRES.EXE to the root directory of your
        bootable hard drive (usually C:).
                

        SCANRES will then become active each time the system is
powered-on or re-booted.  It will check the critical areas of the
system for viruses, including itself, and then monitor all program
loads.  As programs are loaded, SCANRES will scan the programs
looking for viruses.  If a virus is found, SCANRES will display a
warning message and name the infection.  The infected program will
then be terminated.
        Unlike many memory resident virus filter programs, SCANRES
will not cause false alarms.  If a warning message is issued by
SCANRES, you can be assured the identified program is infected. 
Also, since it does not attempt to monitor file I/O or normal disk
accesses, it will not conflict with other memory resident programs.

SYSTEM OVERHEAD:
        SCANRES requires 17K of system memory.  It will add an average
of 6 seconds to each program load.  After a program has loaded and
begun execution, however, SCANRES will not degrade the performance
or speed of the system in any way.

Virus Removal:

        What do you do if a virus is found?  Well, if you are a
registered VIRUSCAN or SCANRES user, you may contact McAfee
Associates for free assistance in manually removing the virus.  We
strongly recommend that you get experienced help in dealing with
many of the viruses, particularly partition table and boot sector
infections.  If you are not a registered user, the following steps
should be followed:

        Boot sector infections:
        Power down the system.  Power up and boot from an uninfected,
     write protected floppy.  Execute the DOS SYS command to
     attempt an overwrite of the boot sector.  This works in many
     cases.  If this does not work, backup all data files and
     perform a low level format of the disk.

        Executable file infections:
        Remove all infected files.  Replace from the original
     distribution diskettes.

        Partition table infections:
        Without a removal utility, the only option is to low level
     format the media.

        Disinfecting utilities are available from McAfee Associates
     for the majority of the common viruses.  If you are not a
     registered user of VIRUSCAN, you may purchase these utilities
     from:
