Documentation revision notes:   

        - April 20, 1988 -

        Optimized and recompiled using the new Microsoft BASIC compiler v.6.0
and linked with CHECKSUM.OBJ, one of Tom Hanlin's superb AdvBAS support
routines.  Now MUCH faster throughput.

        For some reason the simple FOR/NEXT loop which calculated the checksum
in earlier versions of CHECKUP was SLOOOW using raw MBASIC (it shouldn't be
but it is), hence our use of Tom's ASM subroutine.  The BASIC checksum
calculation was the principal bottleneck in v's 1.0 and 1.1, along with
QuickBASIC's pokey 80X87 emulation overhead.

        Another anti-virus technique:  Use the SYS command at least once a
week to reinstall the system files onto your boot hard disk.  This will
eliminate any lurking viruses on the spot.

        - April 4, 1988 -

        CHECKUP does not require that the attributes of hidden system files be
changed prior to running CHECKUP.  As long as the correct name of the hidden
and/or system files are specified on the CHECKUP command line, CHECKUP will
successfully check the file.

This archive contains two files:

         CHECKUP.DOC - This file
         CHECKUP.EXE - Checkup stand alone executable

Notes to users of MS DOS:

        The files "MSDOS.COM" and "MSIO.COM" are the MS DOS equivalents to PC
DOS's "IBMBIO.COM" and "IBMDOS.COM".

The problem defined:

        Computer programs which appear to be normal applications but, after
one or more uses, destroy programs and/or data stored on the host system are
popularly called "Trojan horse" programs.

        Trojan horse programs are usually distributed by unsuspecting bulletin
board system operators (BBS SysOps) and attack users who do not know or care
to follow the proper precautions for evaluating BBS downloads.

        Once a Trojan horse program completes it's deadly mission, it has
obliterated itself as well as the host system's data.  The affected user can
and generally will warn other users to beware of the suspect program.  Thus,
the useful life of a Trojan horse program is limited.

        The newest form of computer terrorism to surface is the "computer
virus".  A computer virus differs from a Trojan horse program in that it is
capable of secretly spreading and infecting other computer systems in order to
extend it's useful life.

        The well written computer virus is difficult to detect using current
file management and anti-Trojan techniques.  This ingenious bit of code
infects systems by inserting itself into a benign program's executable file.
An expertly crafted virus will not change the host file's date or time stamps
nor will it alter the host file's size upon infection.

        Converting the attributes of potential virus targets (such as
COMMAND.COM, IBMBIO.COM, or IBMDOS.COM) to "read only" might prevent some
virus infections.  However, the intelligently designed virus will first check
the host file's attribute, reset it if necessary, infect, then return the
attribute to it's original state.

         When an infected program is innocently copied and distributed, a
hidden virus has another opportunity to spread to another system.  A computer
virus may remain dormant for months and then suddenly emerge to do it's
dastardly deed.  By the time a virus has revealed itself, numerous offspring
may have been spawned.

How CHECKUP works:

        CHECKUP detects potential viral infections by first comparing a target
file's size and then comparing it's checksum on an incremental basis.

        CHECKUP consumes significantly less disk space than using DOS's or
other file comparison utility(s) or vaccines which require a mirror-image
duplicate of every compared file.

        Using a randomly generated block size with each pass, CHECKUP scans
and compares every byte of the target filespec.  If any one of the block
checksum comparisons do not match, or if the recorded file sizes do not match,
CHECKUP alerts the user that the target file is suspect.

        CHECKUP uses a random block size and compare to defeat any future
virus which may be intelligent enough to maintain a file's total checksum
integrity.  It is, in our opinion, impossible for a virus to maintain a
correct file checksum when the checked block size may vary from 1 byte to near
total file size.

Program invocation:

        Install CHECKUP in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  This insures that
important files are checked once per system boot.  If your system is rarely
rebooted (such as a BBS which is on-line 24 hours a day), schedule timed
events to run file CHECKUPs on a regular basis.

        Launch CHECKUP for each file you wish to check.  CHECKUP may be
launched as many times as necessary.

        Launch syntax is CHECKUP [d:][path]filename[.ext].  For example, to
check COMMAND.COM on the default drive in the default directory, the launch
syntax would be [ CHECKUP COMMAND.COM ].

        The first time a file is checked, CHECKUP will create a .XUP file in
the same directory as the target file.  DO NOT DELETE .XUP FILES.  CHECKUP
requires access to a file's .XUP file with each future file check.

        CHECKUP will create and maintain a CHECKUP.LOG file on the root
directory of the currently logged disk.  You may view the CHECKUP.LOG file
with any ASCII editor.  You may delete the CHECKUP.LOG file at any time.

        It is suggested that COMMAND.COM, IBMBIO.COM, and IBMDOS.COM be
checked on a daily basis.  These files are the most likely targets of an
spreading virus.

Precautions:

        CHECKUP creates one .XUP for each checked file.  The .XUP file is only
created once; the first time a target file is checked.

        If your .XUP file(s) are ever mysteriously deleted or altered, it is a
good indication that a "CHECKUP-aware" virus has landed on your system.

        To prevent a CHECKUP-aware virus from gaining control of .XUP files,
keep a back up copy of .XUP files as they are created.  The suggested back up
method is to have a batch file copy .XUP files from another directory to the
root and then run CHECKUP.  This assures the integrity of all .XUP files.

Example of suggested CHECKUP portion of AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

        REM make sure we're on the root directory
                CD \
        REM copy .xup files from another directory to root directory
                COPY \ANYDIR1\ANYDIR2\*.XUP \
        REM run checkup (should be stored in a pathed subdirectory)
                CHECKUP IBMBIO.COM
                CHECKUP IBMDOS.COM
                CHECKUP COMMAND.COM

        For added protection against virus attack, system file attributes
should be changed to "read only".

        There are many public domain utilities which can be used to set and
reset a file's attributes.  Popular utilities include ALTER.COM, a public
domain tool available for downloading from the BBSoft support BBS's (see top
of this document for access numbers), ATTR.COM, also available via the BBSoft
BBS (see 1COM.ARC) and from the PC-Magazine IRS (212-696-0360 or
415-598-9100).

        If you own the Norton Utilities, you may use Norton's FA.EXE to change
a file's attributes to read only.  For example, to change COMMAND.COM to read
only using Norton's FA, enter:

                FA COMMAND.COM /R+
