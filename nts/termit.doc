                             1. Introduction       
 
 
     TERMITE is a general-purpose terminal emulation package for use on
     the TI Professional  and IBM PC's.  It features multiple,
     dynamically-switchable terminal emulations, ASCII and binary file
     transfer modes, and easy access to operating system commands and
     external programs from within the emulator.  
 
     This manual describes the IBM PC version of TERMITE.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     Termite Operating Instructions                                       1
     Termite Operating Instructions                                       1
 
     
 
 
                            2. Running TERMITE      
 
 
     TERMITE is invoked from PC-DOS(tm) with the command: 
 
          TERMITE [terminal] [port] [baud] [fgcolor] [bgcolor] [sfgcolor]
     [sbgcolor] 
 
     The command line arguments are optional.  TERMITE will prompt for all
     of them except the color if they are not specified, or if they are
     typed incorrectly.  These arguments, their functions, and their valid
     options are described below: 
 
 
     2-1  Terminal Type       
 
     This is simply the name of the terminal to be emulated.  Currently,
     only three terminal types are supported:  Dumb (hardcopy), ADM3 (also
     known as a  Tymshare model 430), and HP2621 (Tymshare model 444).  If
     this is not specified, or is specified incorrectly, TERMITE will
     prompt you for it.  Typing a question mark at this point will print a
     list of the valid terminal names.  
 
     2-2  Port        
 
     This is just the async port number.  The valid numbers are 1 through
     4, the first two corresponding to COM1 and COM2 in the system
     configuration.  Again, if the port is not specified, TERMITE will ask
     for it.  
 
 
     2-3  Baud Rate       
 
     Valid baud rates for TERMITE are: 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400,
     4800, 9600, and 19200.  
 
 
     2-4  Fgcolor        
 
     This is the foreground color for the text on the screen.  It defaults
     to white and is, of course, meaningless on monochrome screens.  The
     valid colors are black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, brown, light
     gray (lt_gray), dark gray (dk_gray), light blue (lt_blue), light
     green (lt_green), light cyan (lt_cyan), light red (lt_red), light
     magenta (lt_magenta), yellow, and white.  The parenthesized colors
     are the command line arguments to get the appropriate colors, because
     spaces are not allowed in command line arguments.

     Termite Operating Instructions                                       2
 
     
 
 
     2-5  Bgcolor        
 
     This is the background color for text on the screen.  The valid
     colors are black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta, brown, and light
     gray, with black as the default value.  
 
     2-6  Sfgcolor        
 
     This is the foreground color for the status line.  The legal colors
     are the same as for the text foreground color, and the default color
     is black.  
 
     2-7  Sbgcolor        
 
     This is the background color for the status line.  The legal colors
     are the same as for text background, and the default is white.  
 
     2-8  The TERMITE Environment String     
 
     TERMITE also makes use of the PC-DOS environment string feature to
     make invoking it easier.  Setting up an environment string called
     TERMITE with the same arguments as the command line invocation for
     terminal type, port, and baud rate allows running TERMITE by just
     typing TERMITE.  To make this even easier, set this environment
     string up in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  (See the PC-DOS manuals for
     details.) 
 
     To set up the environment, type (or install in your AUTOEXEC.BAT): 
 
          SET TERMITE=termtype port baud      
 
     with the various parameters just as you would enter them on the
     command line.  To set up TERMITE to automatically run at 1200 baud on
     port 1, emulating an HP2621 terminal, type (or install in your
     AUTOEXEC.BAT): 
 
          SET TERMITE=HP2621 1 1200      
 
 
     In addition, the following environment strings can be used to control
     the screen colors: 
 
 
     FGCOLOR 
 
     This is the foreground color for all characters displayed by
     TERMITE.  It should be set equal to one of the valid colors for the
     IBM.  (See Section 2-4  for a list of these colors.) 
 
     BGCOLOR 
 
     This is the background color for the characters displayed by
 
 
     Termite Operating Instructions                                       3
     Termite Operating Instructions                                       3
 
     
 
 
     TERMITE.  It should be set to one of the valid background colors.
     (See Section 2-5  for a list of these.) 
 
     SFGCOLOR 
 
     This is the foreground color for the TERMITE status line.  It should
     also be set to one of the valid foreground colors.  
 
     SBGCOLOR 
 
     This is the background color for TERMITE's status line.  It should be
     set to one of the valid background colors.  
 
     For example, to set up an environment so that TERMITE displays cyan
     characters, with a blue status line with light cyan characters (a
     very readable combination), type (or install in your AUTOEXEC.BAT): 
 
 
          SET FGCOLOR=CYAN        
 
 
          SET SFGCOLOR=LT_CYAN        
 
 
          SET SBGCOLOR=BLUE        
 
 
     If you have the environment strings set up as shown, simply typing  
 
          TERMITE         
 
     will have the same effect as typing 
 
          TERMITE HP2621 1 1200 CYAN BLACK LT_CYAN BLUE  
 
 
 
     If you have set up these environment strings, and you enter command
     line arguments anyway, the command line arguments will override the
     ones in the environment settings in cases of conflict.

                       3. TERMITE Immediate Commands     
 
 
 
     TERMITE has a set of immediate commands which may be executed at any
     time during normal terminal emulation.  These commands are invoked
     using the ALT key and are single keystrokes.  They control various
     utility functions.  
 
     3-1  File Transfer       
 
     There are two immediate commands that involve file transfers.  Both
     of them are toggles, that is, one press enables the function, the
     second disables, and so on.  ALT-F controls whether the data received
     is put into a file, if a receive or append file has been opened.  If
     the data is going into a file, an "F" will appear in the right side
     of the status line.  ALT-S controls whether data is sent from an open
     Send file.  If data is to be sent, an "S" appears in the  right side
     of the status line.  
 
     3-2  Printer Control       
 
     There are similar toggles for printer control.  Either ALT-P or PRNT
     will toggle whether incoming data is output to the printer.  If data
     is to go to the printer, a "P" will appear on the right side of the
     status line.  
 
     3-3  Display Control       
 
     ALT-D is used to turn display on and off.  This is useful for large
     file transfers at high speeds, since screen output is the slowest
     part of the terminal emulation.  Pressing ALT-D for the first time
     causes the message "Display Off" to appear on the status line and
     disables subsequent display of characters.  Pressing it a second time
     re-enables display, clears the message from the status line, and
     displays the last 16 characters received on the communication port.
     Subsequent uses of this key toggle display on and off, with the
     effects described above.  
 
 
     3-4  Exiting TERMITE       
 
     Pressing ALT-E will exit TERMITE without dropping the control
     signals, so that a TYMNET circuit will stay up.  ALT-Q exits TERMITE
     and drops the RS232 control signals.

     Termite Operating Instructions                                       5
 
     
 
 
     3-5  Help        
 
     ALT-H will display a help screen describing the immediate mode
     commands.  
 
     3-6  Status Line Control.      
 
     CTRL-END clears the message area of the status line.  (See the
     chapter on the status line for more details.) 
 
     3-7  Clearing the Screen      
 
     CTRL-HOME will move the cursor to the top of the screen and erase the
     screen.  
 
     3-8  Toggling RS232 Signals      
 
     ALT-T will cause TERMITE to drop all RS232 control signals for 3
     seconds, and then raise them.  This is useful for terminating a
     session, then restarting, without exiting TERMITE.  
 
     3-9  BREAK        
 
     Pressing ALT-B will cause TERMITE to send 200 milliseconds of break
     state.  
 
 
     3-10  Extended Command Mode.      
 
     Pressing ALT-X clears the screen, saving its contents,  and enables
     extended command mode, which is described in the next section.

                          4. Extended Commands.      
 
 
 
     Extended commands are those which involve more than a single
     keystroke and have a wider effect on the program, such as specifying
     receive or transmit files, changing terminal types, and loading
     Engines.  
 
     When TERMITE is in extended command mode, the screen is cleared, and
     the  prompt "Enter command:" is shown at the bottom of the screen.
     All commands may be entered in either upper or lower case.  In
     addition, commands may be abbreviated to their shortest unique form.
     To exit this mode, enter a null command (carriage return).  The
     screen will be restored, and the program returned to normal emulation
     mode.  
 
     4-1  File Transfer Control      
 
     TERMITE allows you to send a file, receive a file, and append
     received data to an existing file in either ASCII or binary mode.  In
     ASCII mode, all  characters are converted to normal ASCII characters,
     while in binary mode, characters are treated as 8-bits long, whether
     this makes them ASCII characters or not.  This allows binary files,
     such as programs, to be transmitted or received.  
 
     4-1.1  Receiving Files.       
 
     The "RECEIVE" command is used to open a file for receiving data input
     in ASCII mode to TERMITE from the async port.  The format of the
     command is: 
 
          RECEIVE <filename>        
 
     where filename is any valid PC-DOS file name, including any drive or
     path specifications.  If there was a previous receive or append file
     opened, it is closed and all data written out to it.  If the file
     specified already exists, it is deleted and the new data written over
     it.   
 
     Preceding this command with a "B" will cause the data to be put into
     the file in binary mode.  That is, typing: 
 
          BRECEIVE <filename>        
 
     opens the file in binary mode.

     Termite Operating Instructions                                       7
 
     
 
 
     4-1.2  Appending to an Existing File    
 
     The "APPEND" command opens a file for input, but instead of
     destroying any previous data in an existing file, any subsequent data
     will be appended to the end of the current file.  The format is the
     same as for the "RECEIVE" command, and preceding the command with a
     "B" will also open the file in binary mode.  If an append or receive
     file is already open, it will be closed and the data received up to
     that time will be written to disk.  
 
     4-1.3  Closing Files.       
 
     The "CLOSE" command will close the open receive or append file.  It
     requires no arguments.  
 
     4-1.4  Sending Files       
 
     The "SEND" command is used to transfer a file from the PC through the
     async port to the remote end.  The format of the command is the same
     as for the "RECEIVE" and "APPEND" commands, and preceding the command
     with a "B" causes the transfer to be performed in binary mode.   
 
     In an ASCII mode transfer, a carriage return/line feed combination is
     sent as a single carriage return, without the line feed.   This
     allows send files to easily simulate normal terminal output.  In
     binary mode, each byte in the file is sent "as is." 
 
     4-2  Loading TYMNET Engines.      
 
     The "TTYLOAD" command allows loading an Engine through the TTY port
     on the Multifunction Board.  The format of the command is: 
 
          TTYLOAD <filename>        
 
     The screen will clear and instructions for booting the Engine and a
     status display for the load will be shown.  At the conclusion of the
     load, further information will be displayed and you can return to the
     Extended mode command prompt.  
 
     The setting of the thumbwheel baud rate switch on the Multifunction
     Board must correspond to the baud rate specified for TERMITE.  Also,
     this requires a console on the Engine, both to put the Engine into
     the TTY boot and to start the code in the Engine.

     Termite Operating Instructions                                       8
 
     
 
 
     4-3  Querying Termite's Status      
 
     The "QUERY" command shows the input and output files open, if any,
     and whether the receive or send functions are active, (ALT-F or ALT-S
     set).  It also shows whether the files are in binary or normal mode.
     In addition, it shows the port, baud rate, and terminal selected, and
     whether the printer is active.  
 
     4-4  Terminal Emulation Control.      
 
     These commands permit control over various facets of the terminal
     emulation process.  
 
     4-4.1  Status Line       
 
     The "STATUS" command controls whether the TERMITE status line is
     displayed.  The format is: 
 
          STATUS [ON/OFF]        
 
     Specifying "ON" enables display of the status line.   Specifying
     "OFF" turns off the status line, and disables its subsequent
     display.  
 
     4-4.2  Terminal Type       
 
     The "TERMINAL" command allows you to change the type of terminal
     emulated without leaving the program.  If an argument is specified,
     it must be a  valid terminal type for TERMITE.  If none is specified,
     or it is specified incorrectly, you will be prompted for the terminal
     type.  
 
 
     4-4.3  Character Color       
 
     The "FGCOLOR" and "BGCOLOR" commands are used to change the
     foreground and background colors on any subsequent characters
     displayed by TERMITE.  They accept the same ranges of colors as the
     corresponding command line arguments (see Section 2-4  for a list of
     the acceptable foreground colors and Section 2-5  for a list of the
     acceptable background colors).

     Termite Operating Instructions                                       9
 
     
 
 
     4-4.4  Status Line Color      
 
     The "SFGCOLOR" and "SBGCOLOR" commands work just like the "FGCOLOR"
     and "BGCOLOR" commands described above and are used to set the status
     line foreground and background colors.  
 
     NOTE: These commands are only meaningful when used on a PC with an
     IBM-compatible color controller.  
 
     4-4.5  Baud Rate       
 
     The "BAUD" command changes the baud rate selected.  It accepts the
     same ranges as the command line argument.  
 
     4-4.6  Setting Tab Stops      
 
     The "TABS" command is used to set tab stops.  It may be invoked in
     one of two ways.  The first, 
 
          TABS n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6 ...  
 
     will set tab stops at columns n1, n2, n3 and so on.  This does not
     clear any existing tab stops.  The second method, 
 
          TABS *n        
 
     will sb stops every n columns, and does clear all existing tab
     stops.  
 
     4-4.7  Clearing Tab Stops      
 
     The "CLRTABS" command clears all existing tab stops.  
 
     4-5  Miscellaneous Commands       
 
     These commands don't fit into any particular category, but are
     various useful functions available within TERMITE Extended Command
     mode.  
 
     4-5.1  Help        
 
     The "HELP" function displays the commands available, with a brief
     description of their functions.  It takes two screens to show all of
     them, so at the bottom of the first screen the message "any key for
     more..." is displayed.  To display the second screen, hit any key.

     4-5.2  Exiting TERMITE       
 
     The "QUIT" and "EXIT" commands perform the same functions as the
     ALT-Q and ALT-E immediate commands respectively, exiting the program
     and dropping the RS232 signals, or maintaining them.  
 
 
     4-5.3  Screen Dumps       
 
     The "SCREEN" command is used to dump the contents of the screen to a
     file, or to the printer.  If it is specified with no arguments, the
     contents of the  screen saved before entering extended command mode
     are dumped to the printer.  
 
     If a file name was specified, those same contents are appended to the
     end of the specified file, if the file didn't exist before, it is
     created.  If a file name of "*" was specified, the screen data is
     appended to the current receive file, if one is open, otherwise an
     error message is printed.  
 
     4-6  Accessing PC-DOS Commands and External Programs   
 
     TERMITE also provides ways to use PC-DOS internal commands and any
     external programs through extended command mode.   There are some
     limits to this capability.  Any command, for example the PC-DOS "SET"
     command, that causes a change in the memory allocated to PC-DOS will
     fail.  In addition, the limited memory available on the PC may
     prevent you from using some very large external programs.  In this
     case, an error message will appear.  Also, PC-DOS "background"
     operations, such as the "PRINT" command provides, do not run while
     TERMITE is running.  
 
     Beyond these limits, the full power of the PC-DOS command handler,
     including I/O redirection and pipes, is available.  For example,
     typing: 
 
          DOS TYPE TERMITE.DOC | MORE     
 
     will type this document, piping it through the MORE program, to show
     one screen full of the document at a time.  
 
     The following commands are used to access PC-DOS and the various
     external programs.

     4-6.1  DOS <command line>      
 
     The command line is the command you would type at the standard PC-DOS
     prompt.  When the command has finished execution, the message "strike
     any key to return..." will appear.  Striking a key will clear the
     screen and cause the TERMITE  extended command mode prompt to
     re-appear.  
 
     4-6.2  SYSTEM        
 
     The "SYSTEM" command starts a temporary copy of the DOS command
     processor.  The standard prompt is displayed and you can enter any
     DOS commands as you want.  To exit this temporary copy of the command
     processor, type the command "EXIT"  
 
     Both of these commands require that the file COMMAND.COM be present
     on your default drive.  The best way to do this is to have PC-DOS on
     your TERMITE diskette.   
 
     4-6.3  RUN <program> <options>      
 
     This runs an external program, such as EDLIN or FIND.  The options
     are the standard options applicable to the program.  If the program
     cannot be found, or returns an error code, an error message will be
     printed.  These must be external programs, not PC-DOS internal
     commands like "TYPE," and they must be on a disk in your machine.  
 
     4-6.4  GO <program> <options>      
 
     This is just like the RUN command, except that it is used for special
     programs to be developed to work with TERMITE.  As of this release of
     TERMITE, none  have been developed.

                         5. THE TERMITE STATUS LINE    
 
 
 
     The TERMITE status line, when enabled, shows a number of things
     regarding the current status of the program and the communication
     line.  On the far left, it shows the program name and version
     number.  (This document is current with version 4.00) 
 
     On the right it shows the name of the terminal being emulated, the
     status of the various printer and file transfer flags (see the
     section on immediate  commands), and the status of the RS232
     interface signals DSR, DCD, RI, and CTS.  
 
     In addition, an "X" will be displayed when TERMITE has backpressured
     the  communications port (sent an XON), and an "R" will appear when
     TERMITE has received a backpressure character (XON).  
 
     5-1  The Message Region.      
 
     Between the two areas on the status line that have been described
     above, there is a region reserved for miscellaneous status messages.
     Right now, there are two messages concerning file transfer.  
 
     When a file has been sent, the message "Transfer Complete" will
     appear in the message region.  If there is an error, such as running
     out of disk space, while receiving a file, the message "Receive File
     Error" will appear.  
 
     In addition, while in ADM3 mode, if the keyboard lock command is
     received, the message "KB Locked" will appear, when the unlock
     command is received, it will be replaced by "KB Unlocked." 
 
     To clear the message, use the CTRL-END command.
