                                WHAT IS A VIRUS?                            b

          A computer virus is probably the most diabolical and destructive
     form of Trojan in existence.  Like a biological virus, it attacks slowly
     and invisibly.  It almost always infects the operating system by way of
     the hidden system files and the command processor.  Most viruses will
     also modify every removable disk that comes into contact with the
     infected system.  When these disks are then used on another system, it
     too will become contaminated.  Perhaps the scariest thing about viruses
     is that they use every possible chance to reproduce and may remain
     dormant for an extended period of time.  When they attack, the results
     can be devastating.





                                 WHAT CAN I DO?                             c

          The earliest symptom of a virus is usually a change in the CRC
     value of one or more of your system files--these are the files which
     most viruses will attack first. Remember, the authors of viruses are
     concerned with one thing only--the destruction of data (and lives), and
     the more the better!  For this reason, viruses are generally planted
     into the system files since these are the only files copied and run
     often enough to do any substantial damage.  When a system disk becomes
     infected, the modifications to the system files will usually be
     manifested in a change of the CRC value of one or more of these files.
     Based on this principle, I have developed a utility called NoVirus which
     monitors the CRC values of these files automatically.





                               IT WORKS LIKE THIS                           d

         As mentioned above, NoVirus automatically monitors the CRC values of
     system files on any system disk you choose.  Every time it encounters a
     new disk(ette), it will determine the CRC values of each of the system
     files on that disk and store these figures onto the disk itself in a
     hidden, write-protected file.  The next time you run NoVirus on that
     disk, it will find its file and compare the stored CRC values to the
     current CRC values of the files. If the values are the same, then it is
     unlikely that the disk had become infected and NoVirus will quietly
     notify you of that fact.  However, if NoVirus detects even the slightest
     change in the CRC value of any of these files, it will give you adequate
     warning.
     warning.
     NoVirus 2.00                                                      Page 3

                               INSTALLING NOVIRUS

          To initialize NoVirus on your hard disk drive, simply copy the
     program onto the disk (I suggest placing it into a utility or system
     subdirectory to which you have a path set up) and type the following at
     the DOS prompt:


DY


          NoVirus will respond with the following:


     :    ZDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD?
     :    3                NoVirus  2.00                 3
     :    3          DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD           3
     :    3          System Disk Virus Checker           3
     :    3                                              3

     :    3                                              3
     :    @DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDY
     :
     :    Installing...


          At this time, NoVirus will determine and store the CRC values of
     the system files.  When this task is complete, you will see something
     like this:


     :    NoVirus installed.
     :    3 system files detected and monitored.
     :    Use "novirus /l" for listing.
     :    See "NOVIRUS.DOC" for more information.


          NoVirus has now been successfully installed on the disk.  If you
     would like to verify that your system files have actually been detected
     or perhaps are just curious to see what your system files are called,
     you may now obtain a formatted listing of all of the files which NoVirus
     has identified as system files on your disk by entering:


DY


          NoVirus will then perform a CRC check and provide a listing of the
     system files as per your request.


          Please note that NoVirus does not detect the presence of a virus.
     It merely watches out for changes in the CRC values of your system files
     after the time of the initial installation which may have been caused by
     viral modification.  Although it is unlikely that your system is already
     infected, you may wish to reinstall your operating system before using
     NoVirus for the first time.

                         NOW THAT NOVIRUS IS INSTALLED                      a

          To be effective, NoVirus needs to be run often.  I suggest placing
     it into your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  This should be enough, unless you download
     often or think that your system may have come into contact with an
     infected diskette, in which case you will want to invoke the program
     manually at the DOS prompt immediately after you think a change may have
     taken place.  Do this by typing:


DY


          NoVirus will now respond with the following copyright notice:


     :    NoVirus  -  System Disk Virus Checker.  Ver 2.00.
     :                Copyright (C) 1988 by Matt Hill,  MLH Software Systems.
     :                All Rights Reserved.


          If nothing has changed, the notice will be followed by the
     following message:


     :    No CRC change detected in system files.


          If the CRC values have changed, NoVirus will set the DOS error
     level to "1", an alarm will sound, and the changes will be described in
     detail.  At the end of the warning, you will be instructed to:


     :    Press ALT-C to continue...


          This feature is especially useful when NoVirus is invoked from a
     batch file, because it will keep the warning from scrolling off of the
     screen in the middle of a batch processing session.  I chose to use an
     "ALT-" sequence because you may occasionally type ahead and this is the
     type of code least likely to be found in a type-ahead buffer.





                                 TESTING NOVIRUS                            b

          Once you have installed NoVirus on your system, you may test its
     ability to detect CRC value changes by renaming your "COMMAND.COM" to
     something like "ZZZZZZZZ.ZZZ" and running NoVirus.  When NoVirus checks
     CRC values and cannot locate "COMMAND.COM," it will report a CRC value
     change.  This should satisfy your curiosity about the nature of the
     warning.  DON'T FORGET to rename "ZZZZZZZZ.ZZZ" back to "COMMAND.COM"

                USING NOVIRUS ON FLOPPIES CONTAINING SYSTEM FILES           a

          NoVirus always looks at the system files on the logged drive.
     Therefore, if you have NoVirus on your hard disk, you will need to do
     the following to initialize it on a system floppy:

        / Go to the drive containing the disk you wish to initialize.
        / Execute NoVirus from there.




                         SUMMARY OF COMMAND LINE OPTIONS                    b

          NoVirus version 2.00 has two command line options.  To use these,
     simply enter "NOVIRUS" followed by the option of your choice at the DOS
     prompt.  Options are as follows:

          Option     Causes NoVirus to
          DDDDDD     DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
            /L       provide a /Listing of system files and CRC values after
                     the check is complete.  Ignored if NoVirus has not been
                     installed.

            /U       /Uninstall itself.  Use this option when installing a
                     new version of DOS to avoid being warned of a CRC value
                     change.  NoVirus may then be reinstalled by entering
                     "NOVIRUS" at the DOS prompt.




                          SUMMARY OF INSTALLATION ERRORS                    c

          When NoVirus encounters a new disk and attempts to install itself,
     there are five errors which may occur.  Here is a summary of these
     messages with their explanations and corresponding DOS error levels.

          file.                            is that you have in the past used
                                           NoVirus 1.00 or 1.01.  Ver. 2.00
                                           uses a different data file format
                                           than its predecessor, so you will
                                           need to uninstall NoVirus first
                                           (using the "/U" option) and then
                                           reinstall the new version.





                    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VERSIONS 1.01 AND 2.00              c

          NoVirus 2.00 contains a few fundamental improvements over version
     1.01.  The most important is the nature of its check.  Version 1.01
     monitored only the sizes of system files.  The new version employs the
     use of a 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check.  I had originally chosen to use
     file size as my barometer based on the assumption that most viruses
     manifested themselves by a change in the size of the system files.  I
     have since learned that the better viruses (probably 80-90% of them) do
     NOT change the sizes of ANY files, rendering version 1.01 quite
     ineffective!  I then saw the need for a much more reliable form of test
     for data integrity.  Of course, the CRC method was the first to come to
     mind.  Considering the special need for reliability in this particular
     test, I decided to use a 32-bit check (rather than a 16-bit) in order to
     increase accuracy.  Although this procedure does take a little more time
     than a simple size-check, I'm still quite happy with the program's speed
     and I do feel that the added security will make it quite worth while.

                       ALL THIS SOUND TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE?                  a

          I certainly hope so.  A lot of time and hard work went into the
     planning and development of this product, and I'd like to think that my
     effort was not in vain.  I have been using NoVirus for some time now and
     I feel that it's something that I can trust.  I hope that you will feel
     the same way after you've gotten to know the program.  If enough people
     take preventative measures like these, we can stop the spread of the
     horrible computer virus.

         Included with the NoVirus program (NOVIRUS.EXE) and this
     documentation (NOVIRUS.DOC) you should have received a registration
     program called "REGISTER.EXE."  This program will ask you for your nam    address, and some other information and print out a completed
     registration form to the logical device on "PRN" (your printer).  It is
