
                                VIRUSCAN  Version 1.1V44
                                                From: McAfee Associates  408 988 3832

Executable Program size (SCAN.EXE): 39392
        NOTE: SCAN now contains a self test at load time.  If SCAN has
been modified in any way, a warning will be displayed.  The program
will still continue to check for viruses, however.

Note on Version 44:
        This version is a fix for a bug in version 43.  Version 43
cannot correctly find Jerusalem-B.  DO NOT USE Version 43.  Earlier
version of SCAN can correctly identify this virus.

Notes on Version 43: 
        Version 43 now identifies the Alabama Virus.  This virus was
discovered by Ysrael Radai at Hebrew University and forwarded to
us through Dave Chess at IBM.  The virus infects .EXE files and
increases their size by 1560 bytes.  It manipulates the file
allocation table and swaps file names so that files are slowly
lost.
        Version 43 now also checks for the presence of Dark Avenger
in memory prior to performing a disk scan.  This prevents the virus
from continuing to spread while SCAN is doing a search.  Additional
Version 43 enhancements are:
                - Fix to include EXE file searches for DataCrime II
                - Identification of Pakistani Brain while virus is active
            in memory
                - Fix for duplicate reporting when Ashar virus is
            identified
                - Audible beep if any viruses are found (this was      
            requested by a visually impaired user)
                - Speedup of searches for large subdirectories

**** Notice ****
        1.   If SCAN identifies the Dark Avenger active in memory, it
will stop and display a warning message.  The scanning will not
continue.  This is an extremely infectious virus and must be
treated cautiously.  Power down the system and re-boot from a
write-protected system master diskette.  Then run SCAN to determine
the extent of infection.  A disinfector -- M_DAV - is now available
on the McAfee Associates board that can remove this virus.  The
board number is 408 988 4004.
        2.   If you use the SCANRES infection prevention program,
please upgrade to Version 43 of SCANRES before using SCAN 43.  This
will avoid potential conflicts with older versions of SCANRES.

Notes on Version 42:
        Version 42 of VIRUSCAN includes an identifier for the Yankee
Doodle Virus.  This virus was discovered in Vienna by Alexander
Holy at the United Nation's office on Sept 30th.  The virus has
reportedly been transmitted to the U.S. through U.N. employees via
the game - 'Outrun'.  The virus plays the tune - 'Yankee Doodle
Dandy' on the system's speaker 17 hours after an infected program
is loaded.  Both COM and EXE files can be infected, and infected
files grow by 2899 bytes.  No knowledge yet of eventual damage
potential.

Notes on Version 41:

        Version 41 of VIRUSCAN is a response to IBM's release of their
own virus scanning product.  Their first release is able to check
for 28 viruses, two of which were not known by VIRUSCAN.  I have
worked closely with David Chess of IBM in the past, and we have
shared virus disassemblies and live viruses freely.  David has
graciously sent me the viruses I was not currently aware of, and
which their program checks for.  I, in return, have sent Dave the
viruses IBM was not aware of.  Hopefully the two scanning products
will achieve and maintain a parity for future releases.  I have
tried the IBM product and found it to be effective in all cases for
which the product claims to work.  The architecture of my own
product, VIRUSCAN, and that of IBM's VIRSCAN are different, and
with the exception of the 1701 virus, our chosen scan strings also
differ.  I have chosen to encrypt the VIRUSCAN I.D. strings to make
it more difficult for hackers to modify specific areas of viruses
in order to fool SCAN.  IBM has chosen to make their strings
available for easy addition or modification.  Both approaches have
merit.  I would like to say that I consider the IBM entry into the
virus scanning arena not as a competitive move but as a helpful
addition to the array of support tools for protecting against
viruses.

Introduction:

        VIRUSCAN scans diskettes or entire systems and identifies any
pre-existing PC virus infection.  VIRUSCAN will indicate the
specific files or system areas that are infected and will identify
the virus strain which has caused the infection.  Removal can then
be done manually or, if the infection is widespread, automatic
removal utilities are available which can disinfect each virus
strain.
        VIRUSCAN version 1.1V44 can identify 43 major virus strains
and numerous sub-varieties for each strain.  The 43 viruses include
the ten most common viruses which account for over 95% of all
reported PC infections.  The complete list includes (in order of
most recent appearance):

        - ALABAMA (New with version 43)
        - YANKEE DOODLE (New with version 42)
        - 2930 (New with version 41)
        - ASHAR (New with version 41)
        - AIDS / VGA2CGA 
        - DISK KILLER / OGRE

        - 1280 / DATACRIME
        - 1701 / CASCADE
        - 1704 / CASCADE-B
        - STONED / MARIJUANA
        - 1704 / CASCADE / FALLING LETTERS
        - PING PONG-B / FALLING LETTERS BOOT
        - DEN ZUK
        - PING Pong / ITALIAN / BOUNCING DOT
        - VIENNA-B
        - LEHIGH
        - VIENNA / 648 / DOS-68
        - JERUSALEM-B
        - YALE / ALAMEDA
        - FRIDAY 13th COM VIRUS
        - JERUSALEM / 1813
        - SURIV03 
        - SURIV02
        - SURIV01
        - PAKISTANI BRAIN

        It is important to note that existing virus strains can be
grouped and counted differently than the above ordering.  DEN ZUK,
for example has two separate versions.  Likewise, the STONED,
VIENNA, ALAMEDA and JERUSALEM-B viruses have been modified a number
of times. Some researchers would define each of these
modifications, or sub-varieties, as separate viruses.  SCAN chooses
to group them as the same virus, because the same scan string can
identify each of them.  This is only done if disinfection
requirements for the different sub-varieties are identical.  If
removal procedures differ for different varieties, then SCAN will
differentiate between them.

        The above viruses infect one of the following areas:  The hard
disk partition table; the DOS boot sector of hard disks or
floppies; or one or more executable files within the system.  The
executable files may be operating system programs, system device
drivers, .COM files, .EXE files, overlay files or any other file
which can be loaded into memory and executed.  VIRUSCAN identifies
every area or file that has become infected and indicates the name
of the virus that has infected each file.  VIRUSCAN can check the
entire system, or an individual diskette for an existing virus.

Operation:

IMPORTANT: Always place VIRUSCAN on a write protected floppy prior
to using it.  This will prevent the program from becoming infected.

        To run VIRUSCAN type:

                SCAN X:  (Where X is the drive designator)

        VIRUSCAN will then begin checking each area or file on the
designated drive that could be a host to a virus.  If a virus is
found, the name of the infected file or system area will be
displayed, along with the name of the identified virus.
        VIRUSCAN will require approximately 3 minutes of run time for
each 1,000 files on the designated drive.

        VIRUSCAN can also scan individual directories or individual
files.  The command:

        SCAN C:\DIRECT\PROGRAM.EXE   will scan the file PROGRAM.EXE
                                     in subdirectory DIRECT.
                                
        VIRUSCAN version 39 or greater is used by Jim Derr's SHEZ
program versions 4.8 and greater.  This allows VIRUSCAN to scan
files contained within ZIP, ARC, LZH and ZOO archives.  Please
refer to the SHEZ program documentation for instructions on the use
of the new SHEZ commands for running SHEZ with VIRUSCAN.


NOTE: Older IBM clones using DOS 2.11 or earlier do not always
automatically indicate that a diskette has been changed in a floppy
drive.  When scanning multiple diskettes on these machines, you
should press <Ctrl>-<C> after changing diskettes to allow DOS to
reset the drive.  Otherwise VIRUSCAN may become confused.

Exit Codes:

        SCAN will exit with the following exit codes:

                        0 - Normal termination, no viruses found
                        1 - One or more viruses found
                        2 - Abnormal termination (Error)

        VIRUSCAN works only on stand-alone PCs.  If you are in a
corporate environment using local area networks you will need to
run NETSCAN.  NETSCAN is not a shareware product.  Site licenses
are available for NETSCAN through McAfee Associates - 408 988 3832.

Virus Removal:

        What do you do if a virus is found?  Well, if you are a
registered VIRUSCAN user, you may contact McAfee Associates for
free assistance in manually removing the virus.  We strongly
recommend that you get experienced help in dealing with many of the
viruses, particularly partition table and boot sector infections. 
If you are not a registered user, the following steps should be
followed:

        Boot sector infections:
        Power down the system.  Power up and boot from an uninfected,
     write protected floppy.  Execute the DOS SYS command to
     attempt an overwrite of the boot sector.  This works in many
     cases.  If this does not work, backup all data files and
     perform a low level format of the disk.

        Executable file infections:
        Power down system.  Boot from clean, write protected floppy. 
        Remove all infected files.  Replace from the original
     distribution diskettes.

        Partition table infections:
        Without a removal utility, the only option is to low level
     format the media.

        Disinfecting utilities are available from McAfee Associates
     for the majority of the common viruses.  If you are not a
     registered user of VIRUSCAN, you may purchase these utilities
     from:
