   PURPOSE
   =======

     This document will describe the services  rendered  by  the  Network 
     Systems  Support  Center  (NSSC)  to  customers  utilizing BT  North
     America  private  networks,  hybrid  networks and subnetworks.  





   OVERVIEW
   ========

     The Network Systems Support Center provides three distinct services.  
     It  acts  as  a  customer  service  organization;  it  also provides 
     personnel  to   operate  and   monitor   private  networks,   hybird
     networks  and  subnetworks;  and   it   provides   line   management
     services.  Although the  Network Systems  Support  Center  has  many 
     responsibilities,  its  primary mission is  to guarantee the quality
     of service that is extended to the users of private networks, hybrid 
     networks and subnetworks.  

     The specific services provided by the Network Systems Support Center 
     are  listed  below and are grouped according to the three basic NSSC

    DESCRIPTIONS and DEFINITIONS OF NSSC SERVICES
    =============================================

        1. TROUBLE REPORTS

            NSSC will open trouble tickets when customers report problems 
            with  BT  North  America  network technology.  In those cases 
            where  NSSC  is  providing  Line  and/or  Network  Management 
            services,  NSSC will originate trouble  tickets for anomalies 
            which it  detects.  In  either case  NSSC  will  then  become 
            responsible for having the trouble resolved if the trouble is
            network related.  

         a. Origin of Trouble Report

            Trouble reports made by customers must come from a  group  or 
            groups (up to a maximum of three) established by the customer 
            to  act  as  initial  points  of  contact for  the  users who  
            suspect they are experiencing network problems.  These groups
            are  usually  referred to as  Help Desk  or  Operations (Ops)
            Groups.  The customer group(s)  responsible  for  originating
            trouble  reports  to  NSSC  should  have sufficient expertise
            to assist users who may be encountering non-network problems.

         b. Trouble Report Involving Non-Production Facilities

            A  production  facility  is  one which  has  been  previously
            recognized by  NSSC as  being in  production.  Non-production 
            (project)  facility  problems  are  handled by the  BT  North 
            America  project  team  assigned to t he network.   NSSC will
            open  a  project  ticket on a  non-production facility at the 
            customer's  request. Once open,  the project ticket is turned
            over to the  project Team  for resolution  and tracking.  The 
            Project Team  will provide all project ticket status's. 

            NSSC  will  also  open  trouble  tickets  for  non-production 
            network  facilities at the  request of the  project personnel
            for  Non-Order  Entry  System  (O.E.S.) projects and projects
            requiring technical  escalations.  In these cases,  NSSC will
            only  track the  projects to  completion.  Project  personnel
            will  maintain  the  ticket  statusing as  they  resolve  the 
            issues.

        2. PERFORM INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS OF TROUBLE REPORTS

           The Network Systems Support Center has two objectives when  it 
           performs initial  investigations  of  reported  problems.  The 
           first  objective is to determine if  NSSC  has  the capcity to 
           solve the problem.  Then  if  NSSC  determines  it  must  seek 
           further  support,  the  second  objective  becomes a matter of 
           determining enough about the reported problem to decide if the 
           additional  support  is required  from  Hardware  or  Software 
           Support and  collect the information required by these support
           groups to effect resolution.
 






           The  initial  investigation  of the reported  trouble  must be 
           completed by NSSC within  30  minutes  of  the  opening  of  a 
           trouble   ticket.   After   the   completion  of  the  initial 
           investigation of the problem, NSSC will advise the customer of 
           its findings and of the corrective steps that will be taken to
           resolve the anomaly.  

           a. Requirements

              To  perform  the initial investigations,  NSSC will require 
              the following access to the networks being served:  

              PROBE             (Status 20, 10 and 01)
              XRAY              (Privileged)
              DDT               (All license except L.DISC)
              LOADII            (Or appropriate code loading facility)
              TOM

              NOTE: The  license  indicated  above  is   the   maximum 
                    required  to provide the highest level of service.  
                    Licenses which are more restrictive may extend the 
                    Mean  Time  To  Repair  (MTTR)  for  any  specific 
                    problem   type.   If   the  above  access  is  not 
                    permitted, NSSC will attempt to process the ticket 
                    based on the information supplied by the customer.  

        3. RESOLVE REPORTED PROBLEMS

           Whenever possible,  NSSC  will  correct the  reported  problem 
           either  directly  or  with  the  cooperation  of  the customer 
           personnel at the  site  where  the  problem exists.  

        4. OBTAIN HARDWARE/SOFTWARE SUPPORT AS REQUIRED

           NSSC,  after making its initial investigation,  will determine 
           how to correct the problem for the  customer.  If  NSSC cannot
           resolve  the  reported  problem,  NSSC will be responsible for 
           obtaining  the  hardware  and/or  software  support  needed to 
           clear the reported trouble.  If hardware support  is  required
           from   Novadyne Computer Systems Inc.,  NSSC  will obtain that
           support according  to any  agreements  made  between  BT North
           America,  Novadyne and the customer.  

        5. MAINTAIN TROUBLE TICKETS

          NSSC  will  open  and  maintain  trouble  tickets  on  network 
          anomalies.  The tickets will be updated to show  the  progress 
          made towards  resolution  of the reported problem.

          All  trouble tickets are  assigned a  severity  level  based on 
          impact to the Customer.

                    Severity Level 1 -  Impact to  business is  very high 
                                        or potentially high.  Any problem
                                        which  causes  loss of production
                                        and which cannot be circumvented.

                    Severity Level 2 -  Impact  to   business  is   high.  
                                        Serious  problem   not  affecting
                                        production   or  a  less  serious
                                        problem that effects production.

                    Severity Level 3 -  Low  impact on  production or can
                                        be circumvented. 

                    Severity Level 4 -  No impact  on production observed
                                        or expected.
  
          Access  to  the  trouble  ticketing system used by NSSC will be 
          made available to all support personnel so that they can obtain 
          information  from  existing tickets and status those tickets as 
          required.  However,  only NSSC will be able to open  and  close 
          tickets.  

          Private and Subnetwork Customers will be granted on-line access
          to their own  tickets to  allow them to  obtain the  most up to
          date  ticket  information on both  open  and  historical closed
          tickets.  Customers will be able  to status the tickets as they 
          see fit.  
  
        6. TRACK PROBLEMS TURNED OVER TO SUPPORT GROUPS

           NSSC  will  monitor the progress of the support group(s) which 
           have been called upon to work on reported problems.  NSSC will 
           insure that tickets are statused to show  the  progress  being 
           made by the support groups.  

        7. VERIFY THE RESTORATION OF SERVICE

           NSSC  will not close a ticket until the customer verifies that 
           the  reported  problem  has  been  resolved to  the customer's
           satisfaction or under the following conditions:
           
            a. The agency opening the ticket verifies  that  the  problem 
               has been corrected.  

            b. The  agency  opening  the  ticket has been asked to verify 
               that the  problem has been  corrected but fails to respond
               back to NSSC within one (1) working day.  
  
        8. GENERATE PERIODIC MTTR REPORTS

           NSSC  will generate Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) reports at the 
           end of each  month and will  distribute the reports via ONTYME 
           to those individuals who are designated  by  the  customer  as 
           recipients.  

        9. ENFORCE TECHNICAL ESCALATIONS

           After  problems  have  been  turned  over  to  hardware and/or 
           software support groups,  NSSC  will  remain  responsible  for 
           insuring that the progress being made toward resolution of the 
           problem  is  recorded  in  the ticket.  NSSC will monitor that 
           progress and attempt to insure that both hardware and software 
           technical escalations are made at the appropriate intervals.  
   
        10. UTILIZE MANAGERIAL ESCALATIONS AS REQUIRED

           The   Network  Systems  Support  Center  will  use  managerial 
           escalations  to insure  the  quality  of service to  BT  North 
           America's  private network,   hybrid networks  and  subnetwork
           customers. Managerial  escalations  are  performed at specific
           intervals  depending on the severity  level  of  the  problem. 
           These   escalations  begin   with  the   support   personnel's  
           immediate  management  and  continue  progressively up through 
           that chain  of management at the specified intervals until the 
           anomaly is resolved.

           Management  Escalations  are  usually  performed  through  the 
           following levels of management:

                  District Manager or Technical Manager
                  Regional Manager
                  Director
                  Vice President

           Management Escalation time frames for all Support Groups.

                  Severity Level           Interval
                  --------------           --------

                    ONE            -         5 hours
                    TWO            -        13 hours
                    THREE          -        25 hours
                    FOUR           -        At NSSC Management discretion

         11. OPEN PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE TICKETS

           NSSC  will  open  tickets  for Preventive Maintenance services 
           when the schedule for those services has been arranged by  the 
           BT North America project team and the customer.  

        12. PERFORM SPECIAL MONITORING SERVICES

           The  Network  Systems  Support  Center  will  perform  special 
           monitoring services at the request of BT North America project 
           teams  only for those networks and subnetworks for which  NSSC
           provides network  management services.  NSSC will limit the
           duration of any such service to seven days.  
   
        13. PERFORM CODE MANAGEMENT SERVICES

           The  Network  Systems  Support  Center   will   provide   code 
           management  services to the extent that it will copy code from 
           a "development" directory to a "production" directory and then 
           back the code up on a second host system.  The Network Systems 
           Support Center will also move code to ELF if that facility  is 
           in  use.  Code  management  services will be provided only for 
           those networks and subnetworks for which NSSC provides network 
           management services.  

        14. MONITOR NETWORK TOPOLOGY
                  
           The  Network Systems Support Center  will monitor a customer's
           network  facilities  only when  contracted to provide  network
           management.  

           NSSC will  monitor  NODES,  HOSTS  and  LINES  to  detect  any 
           outages which  will  interrupt  service.   When  an  outage is
           observed,  a ticket  will be  opened and  the necessary action
           to restore service will be taken by NSSC.  

        15. PROVIDE CONTROL OVER NETSUPERVISORS

           The Network Systems Support Center will exercise control  over 
           network  supervisors when a network management agreement is in 
           effect for the network.  NSSC will assume  the  responsibility 
           for  rotating  network  supervisors  on a regular schedule and 
           will be responsible for making supervisor changes  to  correct 
           problems involving supervisors.  

        16. EXERCISE CONTROL OVER NETWORK FACILITIES

           If a customer  has  contracted  for  Network  Management,  the 
           Network  Systems Support Center will exercise control over the 
           network to guarantee the highest possible quality  of service.  
           NSSC  will  act  to  minimize the  effect of network anomalies 
           through the use of network utilities to  effect  rerouting  of 
           traffic, etc. as the situation might require.  

        17. PROVIDE INTERFACE WITH COMMUNICATION FACILITY SUPPLIERS

           For those customers contracting for Line Management  services, 
           NSSC  will be responsible for interacting with the supplier of 
           the communications facilities  to  keep  those  facilities  in 
           service. 

        18. PERFORM CODE LOADS

           NSSC  will  perform code loads for the customer and/or project 
           support personnel in support of projects if customer personnel 
           are unavailable to perform the loads or if NSSC  is  providing 
           network management services to that private network or subnet-
           works.

       The  flow  of  information  between  a  private  network,   hybrid
       networks and subnetwork customer and the  Network Systems  Support
       Center  is  of  vital importance  to  both  parties.  The  initial 
       callback after a  thirty  minute  interval  when a ticket is first 
       opened is  only  the  first step in guaranteeing that the customer
       is kept aware of the progress being made towards a solution of the
       problem. The Network Systems Support Center will be glad to accept 
       telephone  requests  for  current  ticket statuses and will gladly 
       read the latest ticket status to the caller.  However, to expedite
       the process the customer can be given access to the ticket program
       so that they  can view the latest statuses as the need might arise.  
                                                     
       The  Network  Systems  Support  Center  will  attempt  to give the 
       customer every oportunity  to  make  his/her  own  decisions  when 
       alternative  courses  of action are possible.  The Network Systems 
       Support Center will be glad to explain the  ramifications  of  the 
       alternatives  and  assist  the  customer in  making their decision 
       if that assistance is required.  

       It is the Network Systems Support Center's  intention  to  try  in 
       every  way  possible  to keep the "loop" closed between itself and 
       the customer.
