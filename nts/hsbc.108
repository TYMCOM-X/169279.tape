------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terry:

     Bruce is doing a wonderful job with PICO these days.  He is performing
lab upgrades and tests with the firmware revisions while I bring in domestic
field units from select sites to upgrade and deploy for live network testing.
My ambition is to verify that the firmware revisions for HKSBCs problems have
no negative impact on the existing customer base we have established.  Already
we know that we are taking a performance hit on the HDLC bit oriented codes
such as X.25 and SNA/SDLC because of contention for 68010 processor resources
on the interrupt driven channels as the interrupt levels for Tymsync and
Mailbox routines have been raised to the same priority.  I have a customer
targetted for testing with a very similar configuration to HKSBC domestically.
I also am sending two sets of test code to London to test with.

     I very much want to install the new firmware in Jersey where the HKSBC
node was dropping out of the network before we dropped the baud rates down
before we send anyone to Hong Kong.  The advantages of London over Hong Kong
are many.  We have highly competent field personnel with nearly unlimited
access to PICO spares and hardware components from Hemel Hempsted.  Their
resources are on a level equal to the United States should problems arise
or should the firmware fail itself.  They can provide us with link level
data scope traces if required and their people are fairly well PICO
educated since the install of their own customer's private SNA network
running on PICOs.  Could you please give me some feedback on when we
might try these PROMs in Jersey from the bank or if this presents a
problem for them?

     In pulling field units in for upgrades and testing domestically I
have found that we have units that have gone to the field with non-standard
parts installed on them and various ECOs missing.  Should this be the case
in Jersey also they will be prepared to deal with it.  For your machine in
Hong Kong I would either like to have you send us a unit back to upgrade
or ship a unit from manufacturing to NTS for us to upgrade/audit prior to
shipping in anticipation of hardware rework.  Bruce is quite good at
PROM/PAL upgrades and testing but he is in no way a qualified rework
specialist should cuts and jumpers be needed.

     Additionally, I like the idea of performing some PICO training after
the upgrade and testing.  What do you think about trying to pull in Martin
Neutin from Australia to meet with Bruce to help in testing and to get 
exposed to the upgrades required.  Martin has been taking care of ANZ
and may be able to make a significant contribution to such a training
session with Bruce.

     At this time I am under considerable pressure to release this test
firmware which I feel we can not until we see how it performs in all
environments.  When we released the 1.7 firmware I flagged concerns
still about Tymsync performance and still while under light loads it
does function.  I did not have revised weighting tables and therefore
could not accurately gauge the point of nor the nature of failure when
the Tymsync service routines would get behind.  The prevent this type
of situation from happening again I am dedicating the resources to
finishing what we started in a timely manner before you receive any
boxes in the field.  We were never able to even go back and formulate
a comprehensive response to the HKSBC Betatest report.  For your
information NTD is just now ready to bring up Speedlink on the box also
which the bank had inquired of last year.  We should be able to test that
also before this release is cut.

     Please contact me with your response and let me know if a mid-Oct.
meeting will be possible.  By that time I believe we can have all HKSBC
concerns and issues relating to PICO addressed.
