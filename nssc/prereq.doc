   PURPOSE
   =======

   The purpose of this document is to  define  those  requirements  which 
   must  be  met by both the customer and various MCDONNELL DOUGLAS support
   agencies in order for the Network Systems  Support  Center  (NSSC)  to
   provide effective  and  meaningful  service  to private network and subnet-
   work customers.

   PREREQUISITES for OBTAINING NSSC'S SUPPORT or NETWORK MANAGEMENT SERVICES
   =========================================================================

   In  order for NSSC to be able to provide support service the following 
   requirements must be met.  The definitions  listed  below  will  apply 
   through the remainder of this paper.  


      Definitions:
      -----------

        TYMNET PROJECT PERSONNEL -

               The  individual  or  group assigned the responsibility for 
               implementing and/or developing a specific private  network 
               or subnetwork.  

        PRODUCTION CODE -

               The  code  which has been accepted by the customer for use 
               in nodes and/or slots.  

        "ACCEPTANCE" ONTYME -

               An ONTYME message generated by the Tymnet project  manager 
               in   which  specific  facilities  are  reported  to  fully 
               operational  and   in   production.   customer   indicates 
               specific  faciltiies  which  he has accepted as production 
               facilities.  

       Access to Current Contracts
       ---------------------------

       Purpose:

       NSSC will need access to those  parts  of  the  current  contract, 

                                   Page 2






       contract  amendments,  and  agreements  to  determine the level of 
       service to which the customer is entitled.  

       (1) The TYMNET Project Personnel must supply copies of those  parts 
           of  the  most  current  contract,  contract  amendments  and/or 
           agreements pertaining to the support of the network.  


      NETDB Database Maintenance    (Reference Appendix I.)
      --------------------------

      Purpose:

      NETDB will contain information on nodes,  hosts,  sites,  hardware, 
      software,    hardware   maintenance   agreements,    contacts   and 
      miscellaneous additional items.  NETDB will allow NSSC  (and  other 
      hardware   and   software   support  agencies)  to  readily  obtain 
      information to facilitate trouble-shooting and repair.  

      1. The loading and maintenance of the NETDB database  will  be  the 
         responsibility of the TYMNET Project Personnel.  

      Official Notification of Acceptance
      -----------------------------------

      Purpose:

        The  purpose  of this requirement is to make it possible for NSSC 
        to determine which of the existing facilities are  in  production 
        and therefore are to be supported by NSSC.  

      Procedure:

        1. The  Tymnet  Project Manager will be required to confirm by an 
           "Acceptance"  ONTYME  that  specific  facilities   have   been 
           accepted by the customer and and are in "production".  

        2. Upon  receipt of the "Acceptance" ONTYME,  NSSC will check the 
           TYMNET NETDB database to determine if the  database  has  been 
           properly  loaded with the necessary data relative to the newly 
           accepted facilities.  
 
        3. NSSC will determine if it has a copy of the  current  contract 
           and/or   contract   amendments   which  cover  the  facilities 
           specified in the "Acceptance" ONTYME.  

        4. If the NETDB database has been properly loaded, NSSC will send 
           an ONTYME to the customer and to the TYMNET Project Personnel. 
           The ONTYME will confirm that NSSC is supporting the facilities 
           specified in the "Acceptance" Ontyme.  
 

        5. If the NETDB database is not properly loaded,  an ONTYME  will 
           be  sent  to the TYMNET Project Manager stating that the NETDB 
           database must be updated before NSSC can begin to support  the 
           facilities the specified in the "Acceptance" ONTYME.  
                 
                  

                                   Page 3






           a.  TYMNET Project Personnel will then be expected to have the 
               NETDB  database  updated  and  then  and send a confirming 
               ONTYME to NSSC.  


           NOTE:  NSSC will NOT attempt to  track  the  progress  of  the 
                  NETDB  database  update.  Until the update confirmation 
                  ONTYME is received,  NSSC will allow the matter to rest 
                  in the hands of the TYMNET Project Personnel.  

        6. If  NSSC  does  not  have  copies  of  those  parts of current 
           contracts and/or contract amendments which cover  the  support 
           of  the  facilities  specified  in the customer's "Acceptance" 
           ONTYME,  NSSC will  send  an  ONTYME  to  the  TYMNET  project 
           personnel  (with  a  copy  sent  concurrently to the customer) 
           stating that NSSC can  not  begin  to  support  the  specified 
           facilities  until  it  has  hard copies of the contract and/or 
           amendments.  

           a. Upon receipt of the necessary contract material,  NSSC will 
              confirm the receipt of the material via ONTYME.  Support of 
              the specified facilities will begin at that point.  
             
           
         NOTE:  NSSC will NOT make followup  requests  for  any  required 
                contract material.  

      Centralized Trouble Report Origination
      --------------------------------------

      Purpose:

      In order to make NSSC's support effective, it will be necessary for 
      the  customer  to provide a single point from which trouble reports 
      will be originated. This single point of trouble report origination 
      will make the issue of problem control simple for both the customer 
      and NSSC.  

      1. The  customer  will  be  expected  to  establish the centralized 
         trouble origination point described above.  
 

      Customer Provided HELP Desk
      ---------------------------

      Purpose

      NSSC will assume responsibility for handling problems  relating  to 
      the  facilities  supplied to the customer by TYMNET.  NSSC will not 
      accept trouble reports from  a  private  network  or  subnet's  end 
      users.  The responsibility for providing the first level of support 
      to the end user's must fall to the customer.  

      1. The Help desk is intended to provide a first level of assistance
         to end users encountering problems when using the network.

         NOTE: The  customer  may  find  it  logical   to   combine   the 


                                   Page 4






               Centralized Trouble Origination activity and the Help Desk 
               into a single function.  


      Operating Code
      --------------

      Purpose:

      Requirements relative  to  the  production  code  are  intended  to 
      prevent  errors  in node and slot loads and insure that proper code 
      is loaded.  

      1) The  customer  must  specify  whether NSSC is to load production 
         code in  the  process  of  restoring  service  or  specify  that 
         customer personnel are to do production loads after problems are 
         corrected.  

         NOTE: The customer will be expected to make his preference known 
               relative  to the entire network.  NSSC will not be able to 
               make exceptions by specific node.  

               In the  process  of  actively  attempting  to  correct  an 
               anomaly  NSSC  must  be  accorded  the privilege of making 
               loads as it deems necessary.  

      2) The customer and the TYMNET Project Personnel must jointly agree 
         on and specify the primary and  secondary  sources  of  code  in 
         those cases where NSSC is authorized to load code.  

      3) The  customer  and  TYMNET  support  personnel must agree upon a 
         standard prefix for  production  code.  (Backup  code  would  be 
         prefixed "BK" according to current TYNMNET conventions) 

         NOTE: In  those  cases  where NSSC is authorized to perform code 
               loads,  NSSC will only load production code and (in  those 
               instances  demanding  it)  the backup code.  NSSC will not 
               load  code  which  isn't  named  to  be  identifiable   as 
               production code.  


      4) NSSC  will not generate code for a customer's network except for 
         use as a trouble-shooting tool.  
 

         NOTE: NSSC will allow code which it has ben generated to  remain 
               in a node ONLY if the customer makes the request and sends 
               a  confiriming  ONTYME  to  NSSC with copies to the TYMNET 
               Project Personnel.  


      5) NSSC must have access to all current  TYM  files  for  both  the 
         nodes  and  slots.  Project  Personnel must insure that they are 
         made accessible to NSSC.

       Access to Network Utilities
       ---------------------------

       Purpose:

       Access  to  the  various  network  utilities  specified  below  is 
       required  in order for NSSC to perform its functions and to assist 
       support groups in performing their functions.  

         The access required by NSSC for the two forms  of  service  NSSC 
         offered by NSSC are: 

         Customer Services              Network Management

          NOTE:  The  access and license listed under "Customer Services" 
                 above represents the maximum  required  to  provide  the 
                 highest  level  of  service.  Licenses  which  are  more 
                 restrictive will extend the Mean Time To  Repair  (MTTR) 
                 for any specific problem type.  
                
                 The access and license listed under "Network Management" 
                 above  are  absolute requirements except where qualified 
                 with the phrase "if installed".  

        1. The  customer  and  TYMNET  Project  Personnel   should   make 
           provisions  for  access  to  the utilities listed above and be 
           prepared to provide the licenses indicated.  

        2. TYMNET Project Personnel should  make  provisions  for  a  DDT 
           username  specifically for NSSC.  Provisions must also be made 
           for NSSC to change the password for the DDT user  name  it  is 
           assigned.

          NSSC will check to insure that the following fields are correct 
          and complete before considering NETDB's PROFILE database to  be 
          properly updated for use.
