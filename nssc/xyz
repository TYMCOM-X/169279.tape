           NSSC  will generate Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) reports at the 
           end of each  month and will  distribute the reports via ONTYME 
           to those individuals who are designated  by  the  customer  as 
           recipients.  

        9. ENFORCE TECHNICAL ESCALATIONS

           After  problems  have  been  turned  over  to  hardware and/or 
           software support groups,  NSSC  will  remain  responsible  for 
           insuring that the progress being made toward resolution of the 
           problem  is  recorded  in  the ticket.  NSSC will monitor that 
           progress and attempt to insure that both hardware and software 
           technical escalations are made at the appropriate intervals.  
   
        10. UTILIZE MANAGERIAL ESCALATIONS AS REQUIRED

           The   Network  Systems  Support  Center  will  use  managerial 
           escalations  to insure  the  quality  of service to  BT  North 
           America's  private network,   hybrid networks  and  subnetwork
           customers. Managerial  escalations  are  performed at specific
           intervals  depending on the severity  level  of  the  problem. 
           These   escalations  begin   with  the   support   personnel's  
           immediate  management  and  continue  progressively up through 
           that chain  of management at the specified intervals until the 
           anomaly is resolved.

           Management  Escalations  are  usually  performed  through  the 
           following levels of management:

                  District Manager or Technical Manager
                  Regional Manager
                  Director
                  Vice President

           Management Escalation time frames for all Support Groups.

                  Severity Level           Interval
                  --------------           --------

                    ONE            -         5 hours
                    TWO            -        13 hours
                    THREE          -        25 hours
                    FOUR           -        At NSSC Management discretion

         11. OPEN PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE TICKETS

           NSSC  will  open  tickets  for Preventive Maintenance services 
           when the schedule for those services has been arranged by  the 
           BT North America project team and the customer.  

        12. PERFORM SPECIAL MONITORING SERVICES

           The  Network  Systems  Support  Center  will  perform  special 
           monitoring services at the request of BT North America project 
           teams  only for those networks and subnetworks for which  NSSC
           provides network  management services.  NSSC will limit the
           duration of any such service to seven days.  
   
        13. PERFORM CODE MANAGEMENT SERVICES

           The  Network  Systems  Support  Center   will   provide   code 
           management  services to the extent that it will copy code from 
           a "development" directory to a "production" directory and then 
           back the code up on a second host system.  The Network Systems 
           Support Center will also move code to ELF if that facility  is 
           in  use.  Code  management  services will be provided only for 
           those networks and subnetworks for which NSSC provides network 
           management services.  

        14. MONITOR NETWORK TOPOLOGY
                  
           The  Network Systems Support Center  will monitor a customer's
           network  facilities  only when  contracted to provide  network
           management.  

           NSSC will  monitor  NODES,  HOSTS  and  LINES  to  detect  any 
           outages which  will  interrupt  service.   When  an  outage is
           observed,  a ticket  will be  opened and  the necessary action
           to restore service will be taken by NSSC.  

        15. PROVIDE CONTROL OVER NETWORK SUPERVISORS

           The Network Systems Support Center will exercise control  over 
           network  supervisors when a network management agreement is in 
           effect for the network.  NSSC will assume  the  responsibility 
           for  rotating  network  supervisors  on a regular schedule and 
           will be responsible for making supervisor changes  to  correct 
           problems involving supervisors.  

        16. EXERCISE CONTROL OVER NETWORK FACILITIES

           If a customer  has  contracted  for  Network  Management,  the 
           Network  Systems Support Center will exercise control over the 
           network to guarantee the highest possible quality  of service.  
           NSSC  will  act  to  minimize the  effect of network anomalies 
           through the use of network utilities to  effect  rerouting  of 
           traffic, etc. as the situation might require.  

        17. PROVIDE INTERFACE WITH COMMUNICATION FACILITY SUPPLIERS

           For those customers contracting for Line Management  services, 
           NSSC  will be responsible for interacting with the supplier of 
           the communications facilities  to  keep  those  facilities  in 
           service. 

        18. PERFORM CODE LOADS

           NSSC  will  perform code loads for the customer and/or project 
           support personnel in support of projects if customer personnel 
           are unavailable to perform the loads or if NSSC  is  providing 
           network management services to that private network or subnet-
           works.  













    COMMUNICATIONS WITH A CUSTOMERS
    ===============================

       The  flow  of  information  between  a  private  network,   hybrid
       networks and subnetwork customer and the  Network Systems  Support
       Center  is  of  vital importance  to  both  parties.  The  initial 
       callback after a  thirty  minute  interval  when a ticket is first 
       opened is  only  the  first step in guaranteeing that the customer
       is kept aware of the progress being made towards a solution of the
       problem. The Network Systems Support Center will be glad to accept 
       telephone  requests  for  current  ticket statuses and will gladly 
       read the latest ticket status to the caller.  However, to expedite
       the process the customer can be given access to the ticket program
       so that they  can view the latest statuses as the need might arise.  
                                                     
       The  Network  Systems  Support  Center  will  attempt  to give the 
       customer every oportunity  to  make  his/her  own  decisions  when 
       alternative  courses  of action are possible.  The Network Systems 
       Support Center will be glad to explain the  ramifications  of  the 
       alternatives  and  assist  the  customer in  making their decision 
       if that assistance is required.  

       It is the Network Systems Support Center's  intention  to  try  in 
       every  way  possible  to keep the "loop" closed between itself and 
       the customer.
