3.1.1.  SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT
 
        FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PROJECT, SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT IS DEFINED AS 
        THE ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIRECTION, CONTROL, OPERATION, 
        MAINTENANCE AND CONFIGURATION OF THE EVTS SYSTEM.  OVERALL OWNERSHIP 
        FOR SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT SHOULD NOT BE ASSIGNED TO ANY USER GROUP WHICH 
        MAY HAVE A BIAS TOWARD THEIR OWN NEEDS.  INSTEAD SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT 
        TASKS MUST BE CONTROLLED WITHIN THE QUALITY ASSURANCE FUNCTIONS OF 
        CS&S.  THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY FUNCTIONS THAT 
        MUST BE MAINTAINED AT THE USER LEVEL.  HOWEVER, THESE FUNCTIONS MUST 
        BE SET, MONITORED AND CONTROLLED FROM THE SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT/QA 
        LEVEL.
 
        SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT IS FURTHER DIVIDED INTO 6 SPECIFIC AREAS:
 
3.1.2.  INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
 
        INVOLVES THE ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH DATA PROCESSING, SECURITY, 
        INFORMATION DELIVERY, INTERPRETATION, AND STORAGE. LIKE OVERALL 
        SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT, INFORMATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
        MUST BE SET FROM THE CONTROL GROUP LEVEL, THOUGH MANY OF THE ONGOING 
        FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH INFORMATION MANAGEMENT WILL BE AT THE USER 
        LEVEL.
 
3.1.3.  SYSTEMS OPERATIONS
 
        INVOLVES THE ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ONGOING OPERATION OF THE 
        HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES WHICH MAKE UP 
        EVTS.  AGAIN, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MUST BE SET FROM THE CONTROL 
        GROUP LEVEL, BUT MANY OF THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONS WILL INVOLVE USER 
        GROUPS.
 
3.1.4.  SYSTEMS MAINTENANCE
 
        INCLUDES ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPKEEP OF BOTH HARDWARE AND 
        SOFTWARE. ALTHOUGH SYSTEMS MAINTENANCE FOR HOST AND SHARED SYSTEMS 
        SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTROL GROUP, THE USER GROUPS 
        WILL BE ASSIGNED RESPONSIBILITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                    PAGE 3
                                    PAGE 33.1.5.  SYSTEMS AUDIT
 
        PROCEDURES AND POLICIES MUST BE A FUNCTION OF THE CONTROL GROUP. THIS 
        FUNCTION IS NECESSARY TO INSURE USER GROUP COMPLIANCE TO OVERALL 
        POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.  AUDITS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ON BOTH A 
        REGULAR AND RANDOM BASIS TO INSURE CONSTANT ADHERENCE TO STANDARDS.
 
3.1.6.  USER SUPPORT
 
        INCLUDES USER TRAINING AND "HELP DESK" FUNCTIONS.  THIS AREA IS 
        CLEARLY A RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTROL GROUP.
 
3.1.7.  SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT/ENHANCEMENTS
 
        A CUSTOMER SERVICE QUALITY CONTROL AND PLANNING FUNCTION.  USER 
        GROUPS WILL ONLY BE ALLOWED TO OBTAIN AND OR IMPLEMENT SYSTEMS FOR 
        THEIR EXCLUSIVE USE IF THAT USE DOES NOT HAVE ANY NEGATIVE EFFECT ON 
        SHARED SYSTEMS.
 
 
3.2.  ________________________________
 
3.2.1.  MIS SUPPORT
 
        A CLOSE ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH MIS WILL BE A NECESSITY FOR THE 
        PURPOSES OF:
 
        1. SYSTEMS PLANNING
 
        2. APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT
 
        3. APPLICATIONS ENHANCEMENTS/CHANGES
 
        4. INTEGRATION TO OTHER SYSTEMS DEVELOPED BY MIS SUCH AS OMNI.
 
3.2.2.  MIS DEVELOPMENT
 
        THE SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT FUNCTION MUST MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP WITH 
        DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF:
 
        1.  INPUT TO DEVELOPMENT OF INTERFACED SYSTEMS AND OR PRODUCTS SUCH 
            AS CDM AND CMF.
 
        2.  PROVIDING INFORMATION ON FUTURE PRODUCTS WHICH EVTS WILL BE USED 
            TO SUPPORT.
 
3.2.3.  ORGANIZATIONS WITH INTERFACED SYSTEMS FOR THE PURPOSES OF:
 
        1. MAINTAINING THE INTERFACES.
 
        2. MANAGING CHANGES WHICH WILL EFFECT THE INTERFACES.
 
        3. INSURING DATA INTEGRITY AND TIMELINESS.

                                    PAGE 43.3.  ____________
 
      STATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS RELATED TO SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT WILL INCLUDE:
 
      1. SYSTEM TRAFFIC VOLUMES.
 
      2. SYSTEM DOWN TIME.
 
      3. MEAN TIME TO COMPONENT FAILURE.
 
      IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WITHIN SYSTEMS 
      MANAGEMENT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ALL REPORTS 
      RELATED TO GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE. THESE WILL INCLUDE:
 
      1.  MEAN TIME TO RESOLVE.
 
      2.  INSTALLATION ON TIME PERFORMANCE.
 
      3.  COMMIT DATE PERFORMANCE.
 
          BY CS&S GROUPS

      4.  TOTAL EVENTS BY:
 
          TYPE
 
          CONTROL GROUP
 
          RESOLVING GROUP
 
          CUSTOMER
 
          PRODUCT
 
          SERVICE
 
          ETC.
 
      5.  VENDOR PERFORMANCE
 
      6.  ESCALATIONS PERFORMED.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                    PAGE 5
                                    PAGE 53.4.  ___________________
 
      THE CONTROL GROUP WITH OWNERSHIP OF THE SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT FUNCTION 
      WILL HAVE OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR:
 
      1.  SETTING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES RELATED TO DATA 
          MAINTENANCE AND SECURITY.
 
      2.  CONTROLLING AND SETTING ALL USER PRIVILEGE LEVELS.
 
      3.  ADMINISTERING DATA STORAGE, MEDIA STORAGE, AND RELATED PROCEDURES.
 
3.5.  ________________________
 
      THE CONTROL GROUP WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT WILL HAVE 
      TOP-LEVEL CONTROL OF ALL INFORMATION PRODUCED BY THE EVTS SYSTEM. THIS 
      WILL INCLUDED DISTRIBUTION TO THE APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AND 
      LEVELS.
 
3.6.  _____________________________________
 
      HISTORICALLY, DVANCF, NSSC AND GCS PERFORM UPGRADES TO PAPER AND 
      CONTROL ACCESS.  THE REST OF THE ABOVE IS EITHER NOT CURRENTLY 
      IMPLEMENTED OR THE INFORMATION IS NOT DISTRIBUTED TO ALL CS&S 
      DEPARTMENTS.
 
 
4.  ___________________
 
 
THERE ARE SEVERAL POTENTIAL PLATFORMS FOR EVTS.  THIS SECTION IS NOT AN
EXHAUSTIVE LIST, BUT DOES PROVIDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE MOST OBVIOUS.
FOLLOWING THE DESCRIPTIONS, SYSTEM ACCESS AND SCREEN FORMATTING
CONSIDERATIONS ARE EXPLORED.
 
 
4.1.  ______
 
      THE CURRENT PAPER TICKET SYSTEM IS A FORTRAN PROGRAM RUNNING ON PDP-10 
      SYSTEM 56 USING A 1022 RELATIONAL DATABASE.  [1]  THE OPTION EXISTS TO 
      UPGRADE PAPER WITH THE REQUIREMENTS LISTED IN THIS DOCUMENT.  
      ADVANTAGES TO UPGRADING THE CURRENT PAPER TICKET SYSTEM INCLUDE:
 
        1.  NO NEED FOR AN INTERMEDIATE SYSTEM WHILE THE NEW SYSTEM IS 
            DEVELOPED.
 
        2.  DEVELOPMENT TIME MAY BE REDUCED SINCE THE BASIC SYSTEM IS ALREADY 
            IN TACT.
 
        3.  USERS ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE PAPER TICKET SYSTEM FORMAT 
            AND COMMANDS.
 
      HOWEVER, THE DRAWBACKS TO THIS OPTIONS ARE SERIOUS AND INCLUDE:
 
        1.  THE PDP10 SYSTEMS ARE BEING PHASED OUT DUE TO THE COSTS 
            ASSOCIATED TO RUN AND MAINTAIN THEM.  [2]  ONE PDP-10 CAN COST 
            $420,000 A YEAR TO USE. [3]
 
                                    PAGE 6
                                    PAGE 6        2.  1022 WAS DEVELOPED BY AN OUTSIDE VENDOR, AND IS NOT IN THE FUTURE 
            MIS DEVELOPMENT DIRECTION FOR BT TYMNET. [4]
 
        3.  SOME ENHANCEMENTS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT, SUCH AS FULL 
            SCREEN CAPABILITY, AND AND MULTIPLE WINDOW ACCESS TO OTHER 
            PROGRAMS.
 
 
4.2  _____
 
      THE PRIME IS A POTENTIAL PLATFORM DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF HARDWARE 
      NO LONGER USED BY THE DIALCOM PRODUCT LINE STAFF.  ACCORDING TO TERRY 
      REED, SEVERAL PRIME 850S ARE FREE AT THE ROCKVILLE COMPUTER CENTER.
 
      ADVANTAGES OF USING A PRIME PLATFORM INCLUDE: [5]
 
        1.  HARDWARE AVAILABILITY.  ONE PRIME 850 IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABLE TO 
            SERVICE 40 TERMINAL USERS.  BT TYMNET WOULD THEREFORE NEED 2-3 
            PRIME 850S WHICH ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.
 
        2.  AN ACTIVE PRIME SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT GROUP IN RESTON.
 
      DISADVANTAGES INCLUDE:
 
        1.  AVAILABILITY OF PROGRAMMERS.  THEY ARE CURRENTLY TASKED WITH 
            DEVELOPING X.400 INTERFACE CODE.
 
        2.  INCONSISTENT WITH THE FUTURE PLATFORM DIRECTION BT TYMNET IS 
            FOLLOWING.  FUTURE EMAIL (X.400) PLATFORMS WILL NOT INCLUDE PRIME 
            SYSTEMS.
 
        3.  A SEPARATE DATABASE WOULD HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED, AND WOULD NEED 
            THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CUSTOMER PROFILE AND OMNI DATABASES ON 
            THE IBM SYSTEM.
 
        4.  A MODULE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED TO ALLOW CDM AND CMF TO 
            OPEN AND UPDATE EVENT RECORDS.
 
        5.  THE COST OF ONE OR MORE X.25 INTERFACES ON THE PUBLIC NETWORK.
 
 
4.3  ________
 
      BT TYMNET HAS INSTALLED AN IBM 9000 MODEL 500 WHICH IS THE PLATFORM FOR 
      OMNI, THE NEW CUSTOMER DATABASE, AND THE NEW BILLING PROGRAM.  
      ACCORDING TO RICH HUNGERFORD AT MIS, THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM ON THE 
      MAINFRAME FOR EVTS.
 
      ADVANTAGES FOR THE IBM PLATFORM INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: [6]
 
        1.  EXPENSE, NOT HAVING TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL SYSTEM.
 
        2.  THE ABILITY TO USE A COMMON DATABASE WITH OMNI AND THE CUSTOMER 
            DATABASE AND THEREFORE FEWER PROGRAM INTERFACES REQUIRED.
 
        3.  AVAILABILITY OF TRAINED PROGRAMMERS.
 
 
                                    PAGE 7
                                    PAGE 7        4.  ROOM FOR GROWTH OF THE PROGRAM AND CAPACITY.
 
        5.  CURRENT DEVELOPMENT ALREADY BEGUN FOR A LINK TO CDM ON THE SUN 
            SYSTEMS.
 
      DISADVANTAGES FOR AN IBM BASED SOLUTION INCLUDE:
 
        1.  DUPLICATION OF DEVELOPMENT EFFORT.  A TICKET SYSTEM IS ALSO 
            REQUIRED FOR CONCERT DATA MANAGER, WHICH RUNS ON SUN SYSTEMS.
 
        2.  ADDITIONAL CMTI INTERFACES REQUIRED WITHIN THE NETWORK TO TAKE 
            THE EXTRA TRAFFIC.
 
        3.  ADDITIONAL FEP RESOURCES REQUIRED TO TAKE THE EXTRA TRAFFIC.
 
 
4.4  _____________________
 
      BRITISH TELECOM'S SERVICEDESK PRODUCT IS A TICKETING SYSTEM RUNNING ON 
      A DEC VAX PLATFORM.  BT TYMNET HAS SOLD THIS PRODUCT TO A RECENT 
      PRIVATE NETWORK CUSTOMER AS PART OF CDM.
 
      ADVANTAGES OF A DEC VAX PLATFORM/SERVICEDESK: [7]
 
        1.  SERVICEDESK IS A FULLY SUPPORTED BT PRODUCT, THOUGH ONLY IN THE 
            U.K..
 
        2.  THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WILL BE PORTED TO THE SUN 
            SYSTEM IN 3-5 YEARS TO BE SOLD AS A PART OF CONCERT.
 
        3.  NO DEVELOPMENT TIME FOR A BASE SYSTEM WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE 
            COMPANY TO SHUT DOWN AN ADDITIONAL PDP-10, IF THE OTHER PROGRAMS 
            ON SYSTEM 56 WERE MOVED.
 
        4.  THE INVENTORY DATABASES CURRENTLY MAINTAINED BY SEPARATE CS&S 
            PROJECT MANAGERS COULD BE PORTED TO SERVICEDESK AND THE 
            INFORMATION IN THE DATABASE COULD BE USED IN THE TROUBLESHOOTING 
            PROCESS.  IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW US TO DETERMINE SUCH INFORMATION AS 
            WHERE ALL THE VERSION X OLD STYLE ASYNC SIO CARDS ARE INSTALLED.
 
        5.  TIME FRAMES REQUIRED FOR EACH SEVERITY LEVEL ARE DETAILED IN A 
            PROGRESS RECORD AND REMINDERS ARE SENT AS WELL AS ESCALATIONS.
 
        6.  ELAPSED TIMES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE PERIODS CONTRACTED BY 
            THE CUSTOMER.
 
        7.  STATISTICS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED.
 
DISADVANTAGES INCLUDE:
 
        1.  THE COST OF PURCHASING A DEC VAX SYSTEM CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING 80 
            OR MORE SIMULTANEOUS USERS.  THE PAPER SYSTEM CURRENT HAS A 
            MAXIMUM OF 80 SIMULTANEOUS USERS, BUT THE SCOPE OF EVTS IS LARGER 
            AND MAY REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES.  [8]
 
 
 
 
                                    PAGE 8
                                    PAGE 8        2.  LACK OF PROGRAMMERS TO MODIFY SERVICEDESK SO THAT IT WILL MEET 
            ALL THE REQUIREMENTS LISTED IN THIS DOCUMENT, AND FUTURE 
            MODIFICATION REQUESTS.  MIS DEVELOPMENT DOES NOT HAVE DEC VAX 
            PROGRAMMERS, AND BRITISH TELECOM, UK HAS A LONG BACKLOG OF 
            PROJECTS.
 
        3.  THE DATABASE STRUCTURE WOULD HAVE TO BE MODIFIED, AND WOULD NEED 
            THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CUSTOMER PROFILE AND OMNI DATABASES ON 
            THE IBM SYSTEM.
 
        4.  A MODULE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED TO ALLOW CDM AND CMF TO 
            OPEN AND UPDATE EVENT RECORDS.
 
        5.  THE COST OF ONE OR MORE X.25 CONNECTIONS ON THE PUBLIC NETWORK.
 
 
4.5  ___  
 
      THE SUN PLATFORM HAS BEEN CHOSEN FOR BT TYMNET'S CODE AND NETWORK 
      MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS.  MIS DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A 
      GROUP OF SUN/UNIX PROGRAMMERS.  ADVANTAGES TO A SUN PLATFORM INCLUDE 
      THE FOLLOWING:  [9]
 
        1.  COMMON SYSTEM WITH CDM, CMF, AND TINA.  DEVELOPING EVTS ON THE 
            SUN SYSTEMS WOULD ALLOW DIRECT LINKS INTO THESE SYSTEMS FOR FAULT 
            REPORTING AND INFORMATION GATHERING.
 
        2.  ALLOW BT TO RESELL EVTS AS A PRODUCT UNDER CONCERT.  THE COST OF 
            DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING DUPLICATE SYSTEMS WOULD BE AVOIDED.
 
        3.  ACCESS BY EMPLOYEES USING SUN WORKSTATIONS.  ESPECIALLY IF FIELD 
            SUPPORT PERSONNEL ARE GIVEN SUN WORKSTATIONS TO REPLACE THEIR 
            PCS.
 
        4.  A TICKET SYSTEM MODELED AFTER PAPER WAS DEVELOPED IN 1989 IN 
            RESPONSE TO A PRIVATE NETWORK RFP.  THE TICKET SYSTEM WAS NEVER 
            ACTUALLY USED OR TESTED THOROUGHLY, BUT MAY BE SOMETHING TO BUILD 
            ON.  IT WAS WRITTEN TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE THEN NETFUSION 
            PRODUCT.  [10]
 
      DISADVANTAGES OF DEVELOPING EVTS ON A SUN/UNIX WORKSTATION INCLUDE:
 
        1.  THE COSTSCIATED WITH PURCHASING A SUN SYSTEM CAPABLE OF 
            RUNNING THE PROGRAM WITHIN RESPONSE TIME AND USAGE PARAMETERS TO 
            BE DETERMINED.
 
        2.  MIS WAS IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING SUN PROGRAMMERS IN EARLY 
            NOVEMBER.  IT IS UNKNOWN HOW QUICKLY THESE PROGRAMERS WOULD BE 
            AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP A NEW SYSTEM.  [11]
 
        3.  A SEPARATE DATABASE WOULD HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED, AND WOULD NEED 
            THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CUSTOMER PROFILE AND OMNI DATABASES ON 
            THE IBM SYSTEM.

5.1.  ___________
 
5.1.1.  BATCH INTERFACE
 
        AN INTERFACE IN WHICH ALL RAW DATA TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE SYSTEM 
        TO THE OTHER IS ACCUMULATED FOR A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME AND THE 
        TRANSFERRED ALL AT ONCE.
 
5.1.2.  DATA
 
        UNPROCESSED FACTS; THE RAW MATERIAL FROM WHICH INFORMATION IS 
        PRODUCED.
 
5.1.3.  DATA BASE
 I (ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE)
       A METHOD OF TRANSFERRING DATA BETWEEN NON-INTEGRATED SYSTEMS BY 
        TRANSLATING THE SOURCE DATA INTO A FORMAT COMPLIANT WITH AN INDUSTRY 
        STANDARD FOR DATA ELEMENT DEFINITION AND DATA ELEMENT IDENTIFICATION, 
        TRANSFERRING THAT DATA ELECTRONICALLY TO THE RECEIVING SYSTEM AND 
        THEN TRANSLATING THE DATA FROM THE STANDARD FORMAT TO A FORMAT WHICH 
        CAN BE USED BY THE RECEIVING SYSTEM.
 
5.1.5.  INFORMATION
 
        DATA WHICH HAS BEEN PROCESSED AND ORGANIZED SO THAT IT IS MEANINGFUL 
        TO THE RECIPIENT.

5.2.  ________________________________
 
      THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF EVTS IS TO GATHER DATA ASSOCIATED WITH ANY EVENT 
      RELATED TO MEETING THE CUSTOMERS' AGREED REQUIREMENTS, TO PROCESS THAT 
      DATA AND TO MAKE THE RESULTING INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE EVTS USERS. 
      THEREFORE, EVTS IS DEPENDANT ON ALL FUNCTIONS WHICH EFFECT MEETING THE 
      CUSTOMERS' AGREED REQUIREMENTS. THESE FUNCTIONS FALL INTO SEVERAL 
      CATEGORIES.
 
5.2.1.  NETWORK MANAGEMENT / CONCERT DATA MANAGER
 
        EVTS WILL HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO RECEIVE ALARMS FROM BT TYMNET'S 
        CONCERT DATA MANAGER SYSTEM THROUGH AN INTERACTIVE INTERFACE.  AN 
        INTERACTIVE INTERFACE IS REQUIRED DUE TO THE EXTREMELY TIME SENSITIVE 
        NATURE OF THE DATA THAT WILL BE TRANSFERRED. THIS WILL BE 
        ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH ONE OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS:
 
        1.  THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED EVTS/CDM SYSTEM WITH A SHARED 
            DATABASE AND COMMON SET OF COMMANDS. ALTHOUGH THIS METHOD WOULD 
            BE THE MOST UTILITARIAN, CDM IS MOST LIKELY AT A STAGE OF 
            DEVELOPMENT WHICH WILL NOT ALLOW FOR COMPLETE INTEGRATION OF THE 
            TWO APPLICATIONS.
 
        2.  USE OF A COMMON HARDWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEM PLATFORM WHICH WILL 
            ALLOW FOR THE EFFICIENT, REAL-TIME TRANSFER OF DATA AND ON-LINE 
            FILE ACCESS. BT TYMNET'S USE OF THE SUN/UNIX PLATFORM FOR BOTH 
            CDM AND CMF WILL PROBABLY MAKE THIS APPROACH THE MOST PRACTICAL.
 
 
 
 
 
                                   PAGE 11
                                   PAGE 11        3.  UTILIZATION OF PROPRIETARY DATA MAPPING AND TRANSFER TECHNIQUES. 
            DUE TO THE INEFFICIENCIES AND OVERHEAD INHERENT IN DATA TRANSFER 
            BETWEEN NONSTANDARD SYSTEMS, THIS METHOD SHOULD BE AVOIDED IF AT 
            ALL POSSIBLE.
 
        DATA RECEIVED BY EVTS FROM CDM WILL RELATE TO:
 
        1.  NETWORK OUTAGES.
 
        2.  NETWORK PERFORMANCE LEVELS INCONSISTENT WITH SET STANDARDS.
 
        3.  CHANGES IN NETWORK CONFIGURATION.
 
        IN THE FIRST TWO CASES THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION OF AN ANOMALY WILL 
        NECESSITATE THE GENERATION OF AN EVENT RECORD.  SUBSEQUENT 
        NOTIFICATIONS MAY BE USED TO GENERATE ESCALATIONS OF THE EVENT 
        RECORD. IN THE THIRD CASE, DATA WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO EVTS WHICH 
        WILL INITIATE AN UPDATE AND/OR COMPARISON TO THE EVTS DATA BASE AND 
        APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT REPORTS.
 
 
5.2.3.  EDI
 
        DUE TO THE ONE-TO-ONE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EVTS AND CDM, THE 
        UTILIZATION OF STANDARD EDI MESSAGE SETS IS IMPRACTICAL.
 
 
5.2.4.  ORDER PROCESSING
 
        THE CS&S ORGANIZATION'S MISSION TO MEET CUSTOMERS AGREED 
        REQUIREMENTS, FIRST TIME, EVERY TIME, NECESSITATES THE ABILITY TO 
        TRACK EVERY EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSTALLATION OF NEW SERVICE OR 
        A CHANGE IN EXISTING SERVICE. THIS INCLUDES EVERY EVENT FROM THE 
        CUSTOMER SIGNING THE SALES ORDER TO THE GENERATION OF AN ACCURATE 
        BILL. THE CURRENT IOES SYSTEM AND THE OMNI SYSTEM WHICH WILL SOON BE 
        INTRODUCED, BOTH ARE DESIGNED TO TRACK AN ORDER FROM THE TIME THAT 
        THE ORDER IS INPUT TO THE SYSTEM BY THE SALES ADMINISTRATOR TO THE 
        POINT THAT BILLING IS NOTIFIED TO BEGIN INVOICING THE CUSTOMER.  
        THEREFORE, DATA RECEIVED FROM OMNI WILL BE A SUBSET OF THE DATA WHICH 
        IS REQUIRED BY EVTS TO PRODUCE EVENT TRACKING INFORMATION ASSOCIATED 
        WITH ORDER PROCESSING.
 
        AS ORDER PROCESSING INFORMATION IS LESS TIME SENSITIVE, EVTS WILL 
        HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO RECEIVE ORDER INFORMATION FROM BT TYMNET'S 
        OMNI ORDER PROCESSING SYSTEM VIA BATCH INTERFACE.  THIS WILL BE 
        ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH ONE OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS:
 
        1.  THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED EVTS/OMNI SYSTEM WITH A SHARED 
            DATABASE AND COMMON SET OF COMMANDS.  AS OMNI IS BEING DEVELOPED 
            ON AN IBM/IDMS PLATFORM AND THE DEVELOPMENT HAS TAKEN OVER THREE 
            YEARS, THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A VIABLE METHOD, ALTHOUGH 
            ON-LINE FILE ACCESS WOULD HAVE BEEN A BENEFIT.

                                   PAGE 12        2.  USE OF A COMMON HARDWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEM PLATFORM WHICH WILL 
            ALLOW FOR THE EFFICIENT, REAL-TIME TRANSFER OF DATA. THIS HAS THE 
            SAME SHORTCOMING'S AS OPTION "1", PLUS THE ADDED CONSTRAINT OF 
            3270 TERMINALS/EMULATION.
 
        3.  UTILIZATION OF PROPRIETARY DATA MAPPING AND TRANSFER TECHNIQUES. 
            ALTHOUGH NOT NORMALLY THE SUGGESTED METHOD, THIS APPEARS TO BE 
            THE MOST PRACTICAL METHOD GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS WHICH ARE IN 
            PLACE, SUCH AS CDM/CMF DEVELOPMENT ON A SUN/UNIX PLATFORM
 
        DATA RECEIVED BY EVTS FROM OMNI WILL CONSIST OF:
 
        1.  VERIFICATION OF ORDER ENTRY AND ACCEPTANCE.
 
        2.  NOTIFICATION OF ORDER REJECTION OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
            REQUIRED.
 
        3.  NOTIFICATION OF COMMIT DATES.
 
        4.  DELAYS WHICH WILL RESULT IN NONCOMPLIANCE WITH COMMIT DATES.
 
        5.  NOTIFICATION OF ORDER COMPLETION WITHIN OMNI SYSTEM
 
        DATA TRANSFERRED FROM EVTS TO OMNI WILL CONSIST OF:
 
        1.  NOTIFICATION OF INSTALLATION/CHANGE COMPETITION.
 
        2.  NOTIFICATION OF DELAYS IN INSTALLATION/CHANGES.
 
5.2.5.  BILLING
 
        THE BT TYMNET BILLING SYSTEM IS AN INTEGRATED PART OF THE OMNI 
        SYSTEM, THEREFORE THE SAME TYPE OF INTERFACE WILL BE APPROPRIATE.
 
        DATA RECEIVED BY EVTS FROM BILLING WILL INCLUDE:
 
        1.  NOTIFICATION OF THE INITIALIZATION OF BILLING ASSOCIATED WITH AN 
            INSTALLATION OR SERVICE CHANGE.
 
        2.  NOTIFICATION OF THE INVOICING OF MISCELLANEOUS BILLING NOT 
            PROCESSED THROUGH THE ORDER ENTRY SYSTEM.
 
        DATA TRANSFERRED FROM EVTS TO BILLING WILL CONSIST OF:
 
        1.  REQUEST FOR THE INVOICING OF MISCELLANEOUS BILLING NOT PROCESSED 
            THROUGH THE ORDER ENTRY SYSTEM.
 
        2.  REQUESTS FOR DUPLICATE INVOICES, ETC.
 
        3.  REQUESTS FOR BILLING RESEARCH.
 
        4.  REQUESTS FOR CHANGES AND/OR CORRECTIONS.

                                   PAGE 135.2.6.  NETWORK PROFILE DATABASES
 
        BOTH OMNI AND CDM MAINTAIN DATABASES CONTAINING CUSTOMER PROFILE AND 
        COMPONENT INFORMATION.  DATABASES CONTAINING INFORMATION RELATED TO 
        THE STRUCTURE OF CUSTOMERS' PRIVATE NETWORKS ARE MAINTAIN BY THE 
        RESPONSIBLE FIELD SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS USING A VARIETY OF METHODS.  
        IN ADDITION, NETWORK MONITORING TOOLS ALLOW FOR "SNAP SHOTS" TO BE 
        TAKEN OF THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION OF INSTALLED NETWORKS.
 
        INFORMATION RELATING TO CUSTOMER CONTACTS, LOCATIONS, ETC IS 
        MAINTAINED IN THE NETDB DATABASE WHICH IS CURRENTLY A 1022 DATABASE 
        RUNNING ON A PDP10. AS NETDB RELIES ON MANUAL INPUT OF INFORMATION, 
        THE ACCURACY OF THE SYSTEM IS, AT BEST QUESTIONABLE. FEATURES HAVE 
        BEEN INCLUDED IN THE OMNI SYSTEM TO ALLOW FOR THE AUTOMATED UPDATE OF 
        AN IBM BASED NETDB. CURRENTLY, MIS IS DEVELOPING A LINK BETWEEN NETDB 
        AND THE CDM BEING TESTED BY NETCON.
 
        SUBSETS OF THE DATA WHICH MUST BE AVAILABLE TO THE EVTS SYSTEM CAN BE 
        OBTAINED FROM OMNI/NETDB AND CDM. HOWEVER, EVTS WILL REQUIRE DATA 
        WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM EITHER SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE, EVTS WILL NOT 
        ONLY REQUIRE INFORMATION CONCERNING INTERNAL ACCOUNT ASSIGNMENTS, IT 
        WILL ALSO REQUIRE INFORMATION CONCERNING ON-CALL SCHEDULES, 
        MANAGEMENT ESCALATIONS AND TEMPORARY VARIATIONS IN THE CUSTOMERS 
        SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS OR ENVIRONMENT.
 
        BEFORE INTERFACES CAN BE ESTABLISHED A DETAILED ANALYSIS MUST BE MADE 
        OF EVTS INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR:
 
        1.  PUBLIC NETWORK SUPPORT
 
        2.  PRIVATE NETWORK SUPPORT
 
        3.  APPLICATIONS SUPPORT
 
        4.  MANAGEMENT ESCALATION
 
 
5.2.7.  CMF
 
        ANY NETWORK INSTALLATION OR CHANGE CANNOT BE CONSIDERED COMPLETE 
        UNTIL THE ASSOCIATED SOURCE CODE IS PLACED IN THE CORRECT STORAGE 
        LOCATION AS SPECIFIED BY THE CUSTOMER'S AGREED REQUIREMENTS.  
        PREVIOUSLY THERE HAS BEEN NO MECHANISM TO INSURE THAT THIS TASK IS 
        COMPLETED. THIS HAS RESULTED IN NUMEROUS INSTANCES OF DELAY IN 
        CORRECTING NETWORK OUTAGES WHILE THE CODE WAS EITHER LOCATED OR RE- 
        GENERATED. BY ESTABLISHING AN INTERFACE BETWEEN EVTS AND CMF THIS 
        PROBLEM COULD BE GREATLY REDUCED. THE INTERFACE MIGHT WORK AS 
        FOLLOWS:
 
        1.  THE CS RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING AND LOADING CODE UPDATES THE 
            ASSOCIATED EVENT RECORD TO SHOW THAT THE TASK IS COMPLETED.
 
        2.  EVTS  GENERATES A REQUEST TO  CMF TO CONFIRM THAT THE CODE IS IN 
            PLACE.
 
 
 
 
                                   PAGE 14
                                   PAGE 14        3.  CMF RECEIVES THE REQUEST AND A PROCESS TO CONFIRM THAT THE CODE 
            IS IN PLACE IS INITIATED.
 
        4.  CMF GENERATES A REPLY TO EVTS.
 
        5.  EVTS RECEIVES THE REPLY AND EITHER CLOSES THE SOFTWARE PORTION OF 
            THE EVENT RECORD OR ESCALATES TO THE APPROPRIATE MANAGER.
 
5.2.8.  APPLICATIONS PRODUCTS MONITORING SYSTEMS
 
        AN INTERACTIVE INTERFACE WILL BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN MONITORING 
        SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THE WATCHDOG SYSTEM USED TO MONITOR THE DIALCOM 
        HOSTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF INITIATING EVENT RECORDS.
 
5.2.9.  EMAIL
 
        EVTS WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE BY INTERFACING WITH ANY 
        EMAIL SYSTEM THAT ACCEPTS AN X.400 MAIL MESSAGE. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR 
        COMMUNICATIONS IN THE FOLLOWING CASES:
 
        1.  NOTIFICATION OF EVENT TRANSFER
 
        2.  NOTIFICATION OF EVENT ESCALATION
 
        3.  NOTIFICATION OF EVENT RESOLUTION TO THE CUSTOMER AND OTHER 
            AFFECTED PARTIES.
 
TS FOR INPUT FROM ORGANIZATIONS WITHOUT INTERFACING 
            SYSTEMS.
 
        IN ADDITION, BY THE USE OF STANDARD EMAIL "FORMS", INFORMATION FROM 
        CUSTOMERS AND OTHER APPROPRIATE PARTIES COULD BE ACCEPTED BY EVTS AND 
        USED TO OPEN AND/OR PROVIDE STATUS TO A EVENT RECORD.
 
 
5.2.10  VOICEMAIL
 
        AN INTERFACE TO BT TYMNET'S IN-HOUSE VOICE MAIL SYSTEM WILL BE USED 
        FOR:
 
        1.  NOTIFICATION OF EVENT TRANSFER
 
        2.  NOTIFICATION OF EVENT ESCALATION
 
 
5.2.11. VENDOR SYSTEMS
 
        INTERFACES TO THE VENDORS' TROUBLE TICKETING SYSTEM WILL ALLOW FOR 
        REAL-TIME COLLECTION OF EVENT INFORMATION. THE CURRENT "PAPER" SYSTEM 
        IS INTERFACED TO NOVADYNE'S "CHAD" SYSTEM. IT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR 
        EVTS TO MAINTAIN THIS INTERFACE.  RESEARCH ON ADDITIONAL FEATURES 
        SHOULD ALSO BE COMPLETED.
 
        IN ADDITION, INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS TO SYSTEMS OPERATED BY OTHER 
        MAJOR VENDORS, SUCH AS AT&T, SHOULD BE RESEARCHED.
 
 
 
                                   PAGE 15
                                   PAGE 155.2.12. OTHERS
 
        INTERFACES MUST BE EVALUATED BETWEEN EVTS AND OTHER SYSTEMS 
        INCLUDING:
 
        1.  MERCHANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (MMS); THE DATA BASED USED BY 
            ELECTRONIC TRANSACTION SYSTEMS.
 
        2.  BITS FOR AUTOMATIC CODE LOADING.
 
 
5.3.  ____________
 
      STATISTICAL MEASUREMENTS RELATED TO INTERFACES WILL INCLUDE:
 
      1.  NUMBER OF EVENT RECORDS INITIATED PER INTERFACE.
 
      2.  REQUESTS/UPDATE TRAFFIC VOLUMES.
 
      3.  OCCURRENCES OF NON-CORRESPONDING DATA BASE ENTRIES. (I.E. CDM VS 
          NETDB)
 
      4.  OCCURRENCE OF INTERRUPTIONS IN INTERACTIVE INTERFACES AND RELATED 
          DOWNTIME.
 
 
5.4.  ___________________
 
      THE QUALITY CONTROL AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IN KEN 
      HOLCOMB'S ORGANIZATION WILL HAVE OWNERSHIP OF DATA MAINTENANCE.  THEY 
      WILL DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT, AND ENFORCE RELATED PROCEDURES.
 
5.5.  _______________________
 
      INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ONGOING OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM INTERFACES 
      WILL BE USED BY THE SYSTEM OPERATIONS PERSONNEL IN THE CS&S 
      ORGANIZATION AND IN THE ORGANIZATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INTERFACED 
      SYSTEMS.
 
 
5.6.  _____________________________________
 
      WITH THE EXCEPTION OF INTERFACES TO THE TMCS, LOADII AND CHAD, ALL DATA 
      REQUIRES MANUAL INPUT TO THE CURRENT PAPER SYSTEM.
 
 
6.  _______________________
 
    THE EVENT TRACKING SYSTEM MUST BE, AT A MINIMUM, EQUIVALENT TO THE PAPER 
    TICKET SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED PC PROGRAMS IN ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE TROUBLE 
    TICKET INFORMATION FOR NETWORK CUSTOMERS.  ADDITIONAL FEATURES CAN BE 
    ADDED AFTER THE CORE PROGRAM IS DEVELOPED.  THIS WILL SAVE ON THE HIGH 
    COST ASSOCIATED WITH KEEPING THE PAPER PROGRAM ON A PDP10.

    BT TYMNET TECHNICAL PERSONNEL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AS WELL AS CERTAIN 
    VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS HAVE NEED TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM.  IN NORTH AMERICA, 
    CS&S PERSONNEL USE PCS AND TERMINALS AS WELL AS SUN WORKSTATIONS.  FOR 
    THIS REASON, EVTS WOULD HAVE TO BE AVAILABLE THROUGH ASYNC TERMINAL 
    EMULATION SUCH AS A VT100 AND/OR USERS WOULD HAVE TO BE SUPPLIED NEW 
    DEVICES TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM.
 
    PAPER IS CURRENTLY ACCESSED ASYNCHRONOUSLY THROUGH TYMNET WITHOUT ANY 
    SCREEN FORMATTING.  ACCESS TO THE PRIME, DEC VAX, OR SUN PLATFORMS COULD 
    BE SUPPLIED THROUGH ASYNC TO X.25 CONVERSION WITHIN THE TYMNET NETWORK.  
    THE IBM PLATFORM WOULD HAVE TO BE ACCESSED USING A VT100 OR LIKE 
    EMULATION THROUGH A CMTI SLOT ON THE NETWORK.
 
    TO SPEED DATA ENTRY AND RETRIEVAL, A DESIRABLE FEATURE OF EVTS WOULD BE 
    FULL SCREEN CAPABILITY.  THIS WOULD ALLOW USERS TO UPDATE A TICKET 
    WITHOUT HAVING TO RECEIVE EXTRA COPIES EACH TIME A FIELD IS CHANGED.  IT 
    WOULD ALSO RELIEVE SOME SYSTEM RESOURCE AND NETWORK REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE 
    USERS WOULD NOT REQUEST MULTIPLE COPIES OF THE SAME SCREEN, AND WOULD BE 
    ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR UPDATES AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN A MORE TIMELY 
    FASHION.
 
    THE IBM AND SUN/UNIX SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY GEARED TOWARD THIS ENVIRONMENT, 
    AND THEREFORE DEVELOPMENT OF FULL SCREEN CAPABILITY MAY BE FASTER THAN IF 
    ANOTHER PLATFORM IS CHOSEN.

7.1.1.2.1.  OUTAGE
 
            A NETWORK OR APPLICATION ELEMENT THAT IS UNAVAILABLE OR 
            IMPAIRED.  AN OUTAGE CAN BE REPORTED BY A CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE, OR 
            BY A BT PROGRAM INTERFACE TO CDM, WATCHDOG, OR OTHER IN-HOUSE 
            APPLICATION.
 
7.1.1.2.2.  CHANGE

7.1.1.2.4.  REQUEST
 
            A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING ALREADY INSTALLED PRODUCTS 
            (EG. NETWORK ACCESS NUMBER OR EMAIL USER ID.)
 
7.1.2.  EVENT STATES
 
7.1.2.1.  OPEN
 
          AN EVENT RECORD IS CONSIDERED OPEN WHEN A BT EMPLOYEE OR EXTERNAL 
          PROGRAM ACCESSING EVTS ENTERS DATA INTO THE INITIAL BASIC FORM.  AT 
          THAT POINT, THE SYSTEM WILL ASSIGN AN EVENT RECORD NUMBER AND THE 
          CONTROL GROUP WILL ASSIGN A PRIORITY LEVEL AS PER ESTABLISHED 
          POLICY.  THE (T)IME (T)O (R)ESLOVE CLOCK IS STARTED.
 
7.1.2.2.  DEFERRED
 
          THE EVENT CANNOT BE RESOLVED UNTIL A LATER TIME FOR REASONS 
          EXTERNAL TO BT (EG. THE CUSTOMER IS NOT AVAILABLE TO RESTART THEIR 
          INTERFACE UNTIL NEXT WEEK.)  THE TIME TO RESOLVE (TTR) CLOCK IS 
          STOPPED, AND SET TO RESTART AT A SPECIFIC TIME IN THE FUTURE.
 
7.1.2.3.  RESOLVED
 
          IF THERE WAS AN OUTAGE IT IS REPAIRED, IF THERE WAS A QUESTION IT 
          WAS ANSWERED.  THE NEXT STEP IS TO CONTACT ALL CUSTOMERS OR 
          EMPLOYEES WHO CONTACTED THE HELP DESK TO REPORT THE EVENT, AND 
          CLOSE THE EVENT RECORD.  THE CUSTOMER IS ASKED FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF 
          QUALITY OF SERVICE, 1 BEING THE BEST, 4 THE WORST.  THE TTR CLOCK 
          IS STOPPED.

                                   PAGE 187.1.2.4.  CLOSED
 
          ALL CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES WHO CONTACTED THE HELP DESK REPORTING 
          THE EVENT OR REQUESTING INFORMATION HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF 
          RESOLUTION.  THE EVENT RECORD REMAINS IN THIS STATE TO ALLOW QUICK 
          RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION NEED TO TRACK REOCCURRING EVENTS.  THE 
          TIME TO CLOSE (TTC) CLOCK IS STOPPED.
 
7.1.2.5.  ARCHIVED
 
          AN EVENT RECORD HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME AND 
          THEN TRANSFERRED TO A SEPARATE DATABASE OR MEDIA.  THE LENGTH OF 
          TIME NEEDED TO PULL REPORTS AND FOR THE SYSTEM TO RETRIEVE 
          REOCCURRING OUTAGE INFORMATION MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN 
          DETERMINING HOW LONG TO WAIT PRIOR TO ARCHIVING THE RECORD, AND 
          WHAT THE RECORD WILL BE ARCHIVED TO.
 
7.1.3.  EVENT RECORD
 
        A UNIQUELY NUMBERED UNIT OF INFORMATION THAT INCLUDES NEEDED CUSTOMER 
        INFORMATION, PROBLEM DESCRIPTION, STATUS UPDATES, ESCALATION STATUS, 
        CONTROL GROUP NAME, REFER GROUP NAME, AND PAST  EVENT INFORMATION TO 
        TRACK REOCCURRING EVENTS.
 
7.1.4.  (M)EAN (T)IME (T)O (R)ESOLVE
 
        THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TIME ALL EVENT RECORDS THAT WERE REFERRED TO A 
        GROUP OR INDIVIDUAL REMAINED IN THE "OPEN" STATE DURING A GIVEN 
        PERIOD.
 
7.1.5.  (M)EAN (T)IME (T)O (C)LOSE
 
        THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TIME ALL TICKETS THAT WERE TRACKED BY A 
        SPECIFIC CONTROL GROUP REMAINED IN THE "RESOLVED" STATE DURING A 
        GIVEN PERIOD.
 
7.1.6.  SEVERITY LEVEL
 
        THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE ASSIGNED TO THE EVENT BY THE CONTROL GROUP.
