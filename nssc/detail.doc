                                  PROCEDURES





                   NETWORK SYSTEMS SUPPORT CENTER PROCEDURES




       The Network Systems Support Center (NSSC) will be responsible for 
       providing the four functions listed below when providing Network
       Management services under contract. 

                   *   Network Monitoring.

                   *   Functional Control of the Network.

                   *   Recovery from Failures.

                   *   Maintenance of Trouble Tickets.

       The procedures related to each of the above  activities  will  be 
       discussed  in  the  following  section.  The  procedures  will be 
       presented as briefly but as concisely as  possible  to  keep  the 
       size  of  this  section  manageable  and  yet  convey the general 
       activities which are involved.  

     I. NETWORK MONITORING:

           The actual monitoring of the facilities existing on  the 
           network will be accomplished with the following tools.  

                 TMCS  (Tymnet Monitoring and Control System)

                 TYMWATCH (PC Program Accessing XRAY and DDT)

                 TELEPHONE ANALYSIS SYTEMS (If available)

                 TYMLOAD (PC Program for gathering "load strings")
                          
         A. TMCS UTILIZATION:
            -----------------

           The  Tymnet  Monitoring  and  Control System (TMCS) with 
           it's  access  to  the  PROBE  logger  messages  will  be 
           utilized as the primary tool in the real-time monitoring 
           of the network.  

           TMCS,  operating in the Display Mode,  will be  accessed 
           through a PC running a program which will detect changes 
           occuring  between  subsequent screens and then flash the 
           changes in a color contrasting with the normal  display.  
           At  the same time the changes are flashed on the screen, 
           an audio alarm will be sounded to immediately  draw  the 
           on-duty  operator's attention to the screen.  All of the 
           normal Display Mode "Fields"  indicated  below  will  be 
           monitored.  

                              Nodes Not Reporting

                              Hosts Down

                              Hosts Shut 

                              Lines Out

                              Links Shut

           The  TMCS  Display  Mode  will be operated and monitored 
           continuously by NSSC.  

           The  TMCS  logger  will  be  utilized  also but not as a 
           primary monitoring tool.  It will be used principally to 
           gather  additional  information  when  anomalies  become 
           known to or suspected by  NSSC.  

         B. TYMWATCH UTILIZATION:
            ---------------------

           TYMWATCH is a PC program which  continuously  logs  into 
           DDT in all ISIS nodes and into XRAY in all network nodes 
           to gather information relative to the general health and 
           well-being  of the node.  Because TYMWATCH logs into the 
           nodes one at a time and because it takes a finite amount 
           of time to recover data from the nodes,  TYMWATCH is not 
           able  to  continuously  monitor  all  of  the nodes in a 
           network simultaneously.  TYMWATCH does, however, perform 
           the tedious and repetitous task of gathering fundamental 
           data from each of the nodes in turn  and  then  checking 
           that  data  for  possible indications of degradations of 
           service.  

           When  TYMWATCH  detects  some  attribute  which  exceeds 
           previously established thresholds,  a hardcopy output is 
           presented   to   the   NSSC  operator  for  his  or  her 
           consideration and evaluation.  

           TYMWATCH, then,  provides NSSC with a system by which 
           potentially serious problems can be detected before they 
           become catastrophic in nature.  

           The  attributes  being  checked  by  TYMWATCH  while  it 
           patrols a network include: 


                Line Error Rates         Memory Parity Errors

                Node Crashes             Slot Crashes

                Line & Link Outages      Hosts Shut or Down

                Low Exec Loop Counts     Node & Slot Restarts

                Causes of Slot Crashes

           TYMWATCH will be operated and monitored continuously  by 
           NSSC Personnel.  


        C. TELEPHONE ANALYSIS SYSTEM UTILIZATION:
           --------------------------------------

           Any available Telephone Analysis System will be utilized 
           as a second means of monitoring  telephone  circuits  if 
           such a system or  systems  is  available.  Normally  the 
           system  will  be  operated  in an "Alarm Screen Mode" so 
           that any detected anomalies are displayed as a secondary 
           source of information on line conditions.  

           Available  Analysis Systems are operated continuously in 
           the "Alarm Screen Mode" except during those periods when 
           the system must be  utilized  for  performing  test  and 
           evaluation routines on specific lines.  



        D. TYMLOAD UTILIZATION:
           --------------------

           TYMLOAD is a PC based program which logs  into  XRAY  in 
           all of the nodes in the network and recovers information 
           about   the   neighors  and  the  line  numbers  of  the 
           neighbors. When it has collected that information on all 
           of the nodes in the network,  TYMLOAD generates  a  file 
           which contains all of the possible paths by which a node 
           may  be loaded.  When complete,  the file contains "load 
           strings" for each possible path by which a specific node 
           may  be loaded.  The "load string" contains the neighbor 
           number,  the neighbor kernel host number  and  the  line 
           number  through  which the load may take place.  TYMLOAD 
           then  generates  a  report  which  is  maintained at the 
           operator's station for quick reference if  manual  dumps 
           or loads must be accomplished.  The  file  generated  by 
           TYMLOAD  is  also  used by the PC Program AUTOLOAD which 
           will be described  under  Section  III.,  RECOVERY  FROM 
           FAILURES.  

           TYMLOAD greatly reduces the time required to obtain load 
           strings and makes it possible to keep a very up to  date 
           record  of  current  load  strings  even in invironments 
           where X-links have been utilized  extensively.  Normally 
           TYMLOAD is run several times a week. 
           
           
            
     II. FUNCTIONAL CONTROL OF THE NETWORK:
       
           The  Network  Systems  Support  Center  will utilize the 
           following utilities to effect control over  the  network 
           as the requirements for manual intervention arise.  

                         PROBE (Directly or through TMCS)

                         XRAY

                         DDT

                         TELEPHONE ANALYSIS SYSTEM(S) 
                      
                         DIRECT MANUAL INTERVENTION
           
                      
           The tasks  which  NSSC  might  perform  when  exercising 
           control  over a network would include but not be limited 
           to: 

                Rotating SUPERVISORS     Shutting/Unshutting Lines

                Halting/Starting Slots   Booting Nodes
                      
                Busying Ports            Freezing Supervisors

                Looping Lines            Checking Accounting Blocks

                Listing Line Shuts       Adjusting Supervisor Clocks

                Retaking Nodes           

           
        A. PROBE UTILIZATION
           -----------------

           The Network Systems  Support  Center  will  keep  a  terminal 
           circuit  logged  into every supervisor on the network so that 
           immediate  access  to  all  supervisors  is  available.  This 
           access  to  PROBE  will be used to effect global control over 
           the network and the commands listed below  will  be  commonly 
           used by NSSC.  

            AU       To list all nodes currently on the network

            AN       To list nodes up along with their hosts, crash
                          counts, and versions of code.

            EXC      To obtain abnormal link statuses.

            HOST     To obtain Host statuses,  the node  hosts  are 
                          resident on and host types.  

            LSTMIN   To obtain circuit status information.

            LSHUT    To list links which are shut.

            LOG      To run the logger.

            NODE     To obtain information specific to a node.

            OV       To display list of overloaded links

            ESHUT    To enter shuts into a link.

            PSTAT    To gather port status on a node.

            RSHUT    To remove a shut from a link.

            SYNPRT   To obtain specific sync port information.

            TRACE    To trace circuits. 

            T2BORI   To remove a line from the sups "bad guy" list.

            CLEAR    To remove all shuts on the links on a node.

            DLOAD    To force a node to its bootstrap.

            NSHUT    To shut all of the links on a node.

            RETAKE   To  cause sup to release control of a node and 
                        then regain the node again.  

            SPY      To obtain information on PROBE users who  have 
                        exercised specific PROBE commands.  

            ETIME    To force supervisor to read the superclock.

            FREEZE   To disable a supervisor.

            HANG     To force specific users off PROBE.

            LIST     To list PROBE usernames and their statuses.

            THAW     To reenable a supervisor previously frozen.

            TSLEEP   To force a supervisor to go to sleep.

            TWAKE    To awaken a sleeping supervisor.


        B. XRAY UTILIZATION:
           -----------------

           Although XRAY is generally thought  of  as  a  means  of 
           gathering statistics and information on a node,  it does 
           have a number of commands which will be utilized by NSSC 
           in the control of the  network.  Those  commands  and  a 
           brief indication of the use of those commands follows.  

             BT    To force the node to its bootstrap

             BG    To  cause  a  node  to ignore resets from a link 
                      which is down.  

             BZ    To cause a link which is currently up to be 
                      zapped temporarily.

             HP    To hang an async port which can't be hung from 
                      the terminal. (Solo Consats)

             IZ    To hang all async  ports  and  reinitialize  the 
                      async code.  

             CO    To  set  hardware  and  software  crash handling 
                      procedure.  

             SM    To  enable/disable  crypto   messages   to   the 
                      supervisor. Used to stop flooding of logger.


        C. DDT UTILIZATION:
           ----------------

           There are several commands in DDT which are used by  the 
           NSSC   in    the    performance   of   Network   Control 
           responsibilities.  Those commands are: 

             E    Used to execute or start a slot.

             H    Used to halt or stop a slot.

             G    Used to force an isis machine to go to a specific 
                     address.  Commonly used to force a node to the 
                     copy of the boot currently in memory.  


        D. TELEPHONE ANALYSIS SYSTEMS:
           ---------------------------

           Available telephone analysis systems are used by NSSC to 
           control  the network lines according to the capabilities 
           afforded by the specific system or systems in  use.  One 
           of the most common uses is to force modems to lower baud 
           rates  when  line  errors  become  excessive on critical 
           lines and the line vendor can  not  immediately  resolve 
           the cause of the errors.  

           The analysis systems are also often used to  take  slave 
           modems out of the master modem's poll list on multi-drop 
           circuits.  This is commonly done when a single drop on a 
           multi-drop  circuit  becomes  a  source  of  trouble and 
           cannot  be  disabled  by  other  means.

        E. MANUAL INTERVENTION:
           --------------------

           Although there  are  very  few  instances  when  on-site 
           manual  intervention  is  required  in  order  to effect 
           control  over  a  TYMNET  network,  the  NSSC  will,   on 
           occassion, contact on-site personnel to manually perform 
           some  tasks  which cannot be accomplished remotely.  The 
           type of intervention requested will generally be nothing 
           more complicated than the booting of  a  node  with  the 
           boot switch or the busying out of an async modem.  

           
     III. RECOVERY FROM FAILURES

           
           The  processes  by  which  NSSC  effects recoveries from 
           network failures are complex and not easily  or  briefly 
           described.  Generally  each  process utilizes several of 
           the  tools   listed   immediately   below   in   various 
           combinations  and  manners  as  the  intricacies  of the 
           problem might require.  Those tools which  are  commonly 
           used include: 

                PROBE                        XRAY

                DDT                          LOADII or ELF

                Crash Analysis Programs      AUTOLOAD 

                TELEPHONE ANALYSIS SYSTEMS   MANUAL INTERVENTION

           Due to the complex nature of Failure Recovery Procedures 
           and the need to maintain some control over the volume of 
           the  material  to be included in this proposal,  we will 
           begin with a general outline of the procedures which are 
           common to all Failure Recovery attempts.  Then  we  will 
           consider  the general categories of network failures and 
           briefly describe the processes which might  be  employed 
           in resolving the failure.  


        A. PROCEDURES COMMON TO ALL FAILURE RECOVERY EFFORTS:
           ------------------------------------------------- 

           1. TROUBLE TICKETS:

                The   Network  Systems  Support  Center  will  open 
                trouble tickets on every network anomaly  which  is 
                observed  or  reported  to  it.  As each succeeding 
                step  in the effort to restore service occurs,  the 
                ticket will be statused to show what is being done.  
                When the anomaly appears to be corrected, NSSC will 
                ask the customer Help Desk to verify  the  fix.  If 
                the fix has been successfull,  NSSC will then close 
                the trouble ticket with the permission of the  Help 
                Desk.  

           2. TAKING DOWN PRODUCTION FACILITIES: 

                If it is necessary for NSSC to interrupt service in 
                any operational  network  facility  to  work  on  a 
                network  failure,  NSSC will obtain permission from 
                the customer Help Desk  to  disrupt  that  existing 
                service.  NSSC  will  not  unilaterally take active 
                facilities down if the Help Desk  is  available  to 
                judge  the  impact  of that action on the end users 
                who might be affected.  

           3. ACQUIRING HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE SUPPORT:

                In  those  instances  where  it is found necessary, 
                NSSC will obtain hardware and/or  software  support 
                to  accomplish the final resolution of the problem.  
                NSSC  will,  within  30  minute  of  detecting  the 
                anomaly or learning about it,  make a determination 
                about  the  cause  of  the   problem.   From   that 
                determination   NSSC   will   either   be  able  to 
                immediately restore service or will decide  whether 
                the  problem  must  be  passed  on  to  hardware or 
                software support personnel.  
                
           4. MANAGERIAL ESCALATIONS:
                
                When  anomalies  are  turned  over  to TYMNET or to 
                Field Service Company support  personnel, NSSC 

                will continue to monitor the tickets to access  the 
                progress  being  made  toward a solution.  Based on 
                the current TYMNET  Escalation  Policy,  NSSC  will 
                make  managerial  escalations  to  both  TYMNET and 
                Field Service Company managers in order  to  insure 
                that the maximum possible effort is directed toward 
                the final resolution of the problem.  

           5. DUMPING AND RELOADING CODE:
           
                If  a node or slot crashes and remains down for the 
                first time in a period of  four  weeks,  NSSC  will 
                reload the node or slot with the r code.  Then 
                the ticket will be closed.  

                If a node crashes amd remains down for the second 
                time in a four week period,  the crash table will 
                be  dumped  and  will immediately be checked.  If 
                the crash table dump isn't definitive,  the  node 
                will  be  dumped  from  location 0 up through and 
                including  all  of  the  node  code.   After  the 
                dumping has been completed, the correct code will 
                be reloaded into the machine and the dump will be 
                analyized  to  determine  the cause of the crash.  
                Any  subsequent  action  taken  will   be   based 
                primarily on the interpretation of the dump..  

                If a slot crashes and remains down for the second 
                time  in  a  four  week period,  the slot will be 
                dumped and the proper code will be reloaded.  The 
                slot dump will then be turned  over  to  software 
                support personnel for a rigorous examination.  
                
                If  a  node or slot crashes and comes back up for 
                the first time in a period of  four  weeks,  NSSC 
                will open and close a ticket to record the event.  
                                
                If  either a node or slot crashes and comes back up 
                for the second time in a  four  week  period,  NSSC 
                will   collect   the   node  or  slot  crash  table 
                information.  NSSC will the proceed  based  on  the 
                contents of the crash table.  


        B. PROCEDURES RELATED TO SPECIFIC TYPES OF OUTAGES
           -----------------------------------------------
           
           Having looked at some of the procedures  which  will  be 
           common to all outages, we'll now give some consideration 
           to specific outages.  


           1. INTERNODAL LINE ANOMALIES:
              --------------------------

                On those internodal links  for  which   NSSC  has 
                responsibility,  NSSC  will  attempt to determine 

                whether the problem is due to a telephone circuit 
                problem  or  whether  it  might  be  due  to node 
                problems.  
                 
                If telephone Analysis equipment is available,  NSSC 
                will run tests on the individual  modems  and  then 
                will  run  end to end tests on the line between the 
                modems.  If no problems are revealed by  the  modem 
                and  line  tests,  NSSC  will  place the individual 
                modems in analog loopback and will then run  LINTST 
                from each node to it's own modem and back. (Because 
                LINTST  can be run on a node which is still running 
                its  normal  code,   no  additional  disruption  of 
                service  on  the  nodes  will occur.) Occassionally 
                NSSC will place a modem in digital looback and  run 
                LINTST  through the distant node,  through the line 
                to the  looped  modem  and  then  back  to  collect 
                additional information relative to the failure.  

                If telephone analysis equipment is  not  available, 
                NSSC  will normally contact the line vendor to have 
                the  line  tested  from  the  PCO   to   the   line 
                terminations  at  both ends.  If no problems appear 
                to exist on the line,  NSSC would then  proceed  as 
                described  above  but  would be requesting that the 
                site manually perform the modem and the end to  end 
                line  tests  as  well  as  loop  the modems so that 
                LINTST can be run.  

                If a line fails to come up after a code load,  NSSC 
                would examine  the  TYM  files  of  the  two  nodes 
                involved to determine if an error had been made  in 
                the  preparation  of  the TYM file.  If an error is 
                found,  NSSC would turn it over to a communications 
                consultant  for  correction.  If no error is found, 
                NSSC might elect to generate new code from the  TYM 
                file  and  check  it  against  the existing code to 
                determine if the existing code  is,  in  fact,  the 
                correct code.  

           2. ANOMALIES ON LINES ASSOCIATED WITH ISIS SLOTS: 
              ----------------------------------------------

                When  lines  associated  with  ISIS slots,  fail or 
                appear to fail, it is often possible to gather some 
                useful  information  about  the  failure  from  the 
                Extended DDT functions available in the slot  code.  
                On  those  lines for which NSSC has responsibility, 
                NSSC would look at that possibility first.  Then if 
                telephone  analysis  equipment  is  available,  the 
                modems   would   be  individually  tested  and  the 
                available line tests would be executed between  the 
                two  modems.  If the line has no remote testing and 
                control facilities available,  NSSC  would  request 
                that  the  line  vendor  run line tests to the line 
                terminations at both ends of the line.  

                If additional  testing  is  required  in  order  to 
                determine the source of the failure,  NSSC would be 
                forced to utilize the slot  diagnostics  SLSYNC  or 
                SLSIO  which  will disrupt service in the slot into 
                which they are loaded.  If other traffic exists  on 
                the slot involved and an unused slot is  available, 
                NSSC would utilize DDT to transfer the logical unit 
                for the line to the unused slot and NSSC would then 
                load  SLSYNC  or SLSIO into the unused slot.  After 
                placing the local modem in analog loopback remotely 
                or  with  the cooperation of personnel at the site, 
                NSSC would run the test from the slot to the  modem 
                and back.  If a spare slot is  not  availble,  NSSC 
                would  request that the customer Help Desk agree to 
                have NSSC take the slot down for further testing.  

                When  the trouble has been clearly defined on lines 
                for which NSSC has responsibility,  NSSC will  have 
                the  anomaly  resolved  by the appropriate party or 
                parties.  

           3. NODE ANOMALIES:
              ---------------

                In Section 3.A.5, DUMPING AND RELOADING CODE, the 
                first steps in the process of attempting to recover 
                from node failures have been defined.  In the event 
                that the node doesn't respond to  dump  and  reload 
                attempts, NSSC will attempt to contact the site and 
                have  the  node booted.  Quite possibly the on-site 
                person will be asked to describe the existing front 
                panel display and possibly check  the  availability 
                of  power.  The on-site person may also be asked to 
                check the internodal link modems to be certain that 
                they have power.  

                The crash table dump and/or code dump is  the  most 
                valuable  tool available to NSSC when attempting to 
                recover from node outages.  NSSC  will  attempt  to 
                recover  the  crash  table  dump  first  because it 
                requires very little time  to  transfer  the  crash 
                table  information out of the node.  NSSC will then 
                analyize the crash table  information  and  if  the 
                information indicates the cause of the crash,  NSSC 
                will attempt to restore service with  a  reload  of 
                the  code.  If  the  crash table information is not 
                definitive,  NSSC will run MERLIN to determine  the 
                end  of the Slot 0 code and then will dump the node 
                from memory location  0  through  the  last  memory 
                location  used by Slot 0.  Although dumping so much 
                memory is time consuming,  it  is  accomplished  to 
                insure  that some evidence relating to the cause of 
                the crash is obtained.  

                In the event  that  the  reload  does  not  restore 
                service, NSSC will dispatch field service personnel 
                to attend to the node.  If service is restored with 
                the  reload,  NSSC  will pursue the analysis of the 
                dump and  take  any  additional  corrective  action 
                which might be warranted.  

                In  those  instances  where a node crashes and then 
                returns  to  the  network,  NSSC  will  attempt  to 
                recover  the  crash identifier from the loggers and 
                failing that will read the crash table out  of  the 
                node when it has returned to service.  The analysis 
                of  the  crash  table  information then will be the 
                justification for subsequent steps.  
                
                As indicated in Section 3.A.5,  NSSC will  normally 
                not investigate a node crash in detail if it is the 
                first  crash  to  occur  in  a four week period.  A 
                ticket will be opened on the node at  the  time  of 
                any  crash but if previous tickets indicate that no 
                problem has occured in the previous four weeks, the 
                ticket will simply be closed again  providing  that 
                the node is successfully returned to service.  


           4. SLOT ANOMALIES:
              ---------------

                The  dump  and  reload  procedures  for  slots  are 
                described  in Section 3.A.5,  DUMPING AND RELOADING 
                CODE.  Normally the dump and reload efforts will be 
                the first  action  taken  on  any  slot  which  has 
                crashed  and  remained  down.  If  the  slot can be 
                brought back into service with a  reload  of  code, 
                the  dump  taken prior to the reload will be turned 
                over to software support personnel for  study.  Any 
                further  action which is deemed necessary after the 
                dump is analyized will be taken to  prevent  future 
                crashes.  

                If  a  slot  crashes and recovers and it is not the 
                first crash to occur in the  previous  four  weeks, 
                NSSC  will  attempt  to gather the slot crash table 
                information and any DDT information relating to the 
                crash  which  can  be  obtained.   The  information 
                collected  in  that manner will be entered into the 
                trouble ticket and the ticket will be  turned  over 
                to  software  support  personnel for their analysis 
                and recommendations.  
                
                In those instances where a slot begins to crash and 
                recover   continuously   even  after  a  reload  is 
                accomplished,  NSSC will halt the slot  to  prevent 
                flooding   of  the  logger  and  will  then  obtain 
                software support to assist in determining the cause 
                of the crashes.  

                Those slot anomalies which do  no  result  in  slot 
                crashes  will  be  investigated  primarily with DDT 
                although again  any  available  telephone  analysis 
                equipment  may  be  utilized also.  NSSC may try to 
                halt  and  restart  the  slot  if   a   preliminary 
                investigation indicates that might be helpful and a 
                dump  and  reload  of the slot may be undertaken if 
                that seems warranted.  


     IV. MAINTENANCE OF TROUBLE TICKETS


           
           The Trouble Ticketing System used by NSSC  is  an  abso-
           lute  necessity  for  tracking  the  progress  of repair 
           efforts, maintaining a record of the steps already taken 
           in the effort to fully  restore  service  and  also  for 
           generating Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR) reports.  
           

        A. ACCESS TO TROUBLE TICKET INFORMATION
           
           The  customer  will  have  access to the on-line Trouble 
           Ticketing System so that customer  personnel  will  have 
           immediate access to the latest ticket statuses.  It will 
           also  be  possible  for  customer  personnel  to  obtain 
           information from closed tickets for  up  to  six  months 
           after they have been closed.  


        B. MEAN TIME TO RESOLVE (MTTR) REPORTS

           A Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR) Report will  be  generated 
           at  the end of each month presenting the MTTR statistics 
           which  were  collected  on  tickets  processed  for  the 
           customer  network during the month.  The reports will be 
           distributed via ONTYME.  

        C. TROUBLE TICKETING SYSTEM PROCEDURES 

           All of  the  currently  open  trouble  tickets  for  the 
           customer  will be printed at the beginning of each shift 

           and NSSC personnel will examine each ticket and evaluate 
           the  statuses to determine what additional action should 
           be taken.  

           During the course of the shift,  work will  continue  on 
           those tickets. The trouble ticketing system's ability to 
           flag tickets requiring status will be utilized to insure 
           that  an  acceptable  level of activity is maintained on 
           all open tickets.
