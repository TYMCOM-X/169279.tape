Hello there !

When trying to read tickets, I get the message :
ERROR TYPE=4   ERROR CODE=2

and a mention that I should report this to you.

So, I'm stuck with the unability to read and update my tickets until this is
fixed. This kind of situation induces an extra delay in the ticket resolution.
I hope it won't last.

For your information, the ticket numbers I was trying to read are actually
refered to my group (#78).

Thanks.
Stephane FISBEIN. European Customer Support Group.
