SUBJ:  PATCH TO BRING UP THE LINK IMMEDIATELY AFTER RECEIVING SABM
       FOR XCOM HDLC LAPB
       (PNTS:37) SABM.PAT

==========================================================================

   SYMPTOM: ON X.25/X75 HDLC LAPB, TYMNET's XCOM INTERFACE
            DOESN'T BRING UP THE LINK AFTER RESPONDING UA
            TO THE SABM RECEIVED FROM THE LINK.

   CCITT  : ON LAPB, THE LINK SHOULD BE UP AFTER SABM-UA EXCHANGE.

   TYMNET : TYMNET's X.25/X75 INTERFACE HANDLES THE LINK SET-UP MORE
            CAUTIOUSLY. AFTER THE SLOT IS RESTARTED, OUR XCOM WILL SEND
            SABM OUT. IF THEN WE RECEIVE SABM, WE RESPOND UA.
            BUT, WE DO NOT BRING UP THE LINK AT THIS TIME DUE TO SOME
            REASONS SUCH AS 'OUR UA MAY BE LOST'. WE WILL NOT BRING
            UP THE LINK UNTIL WE RECEIVE 'UA' RESPONSE FOR OUR SABM.

            MOST CUSTOMERS HAVE NO PROBLEM TO HAVE THEIR X.25 TALK TO
            OUR XCOM HDLC LAPB. BUT, SOME CUSTOMERS GOT THE ABOVE
            SYMPTOM JUST BECAUSE OUR XCOM DOESN'T BRING UP THE LINK
            IMMEDIATELY AFTER RESPONDING UA FOR THE SABM RECEIVED FROM 
            THE LINK.
   PATCH  : (PNTS:37) SABM.PAT. THIS PATCH FORCES THE XCOM TO BRING UP
            THE LINK IMMEDIATELY AFTER RESPONDING UA FOR THE SABM
            RECEIVED FROM THE LINK. THIS PATCH CAN BE USED FOR VERSION
            3.00, 3.01.

   NTD    : NTD IS GOING TO RELEASE A SIMILAR PATCH FOR VERSION 3.01.
