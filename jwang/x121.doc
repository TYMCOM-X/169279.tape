                            X.121 Addressing

      CCITT standard  X.121 defines a  universal standard  structure for
      addressing data terminals that  insures that a data terminal  on a
      public  network  can  be  accessed  using  the  same  address from
      anywhere in the world.

      A data terminal is defined as any addressable entity  connected to
      the network, i.e., user  terminals, host computers and  host front
      ends.  The address consists of a Data Network  Identification Code
      (DNIC) and a  Network Terminal Number (NTN).   The DNIC is  a four
      digit  number  used  to  uniquely  identify  a  particular  public
      network.   For  example,  the TYMNET  domestic  public  network is
      assigned  the DNIC  3106.  X.121  allows an  NTN to  be up  to 10
      digits in  length.  The  NTN is not  otherwise restricted  and the
      definition of its format is left to the network implementors.

      The format of the NTN for public networks using  TYMNET technology
      will be as follows.

           a)  If DNIC does not indicate the local network, NTN may
               be of any format of from zero to ten digits.

           b)
               0 + <5 digit host number> + <0 to 4 digit subaddress>

               This format is used as a called or  calling address.
               The host  number is a  destination host  number with
               leading zeros.  The subaddress is optional.

           c)  7 + <5 digit host number>

               This format is used only as a calling  address.  The
               host number is an originating only host number (less
               than  65532).   A  call  cannot  be  placed  to this
               number.

     >       The  supervisor  has not  yet  implemented originating
           only  host  numbers.   When  this  is  implemented,  the
                                                     Page 16


           destination interface will be informed that the  call is
           from  an originate  only host.   For an  interim period,
           TYMSATs  report "accounting"  host numbers  greater than
           16000 and host numbers  in this range can  be considered
           origination only.

           d)  77 + <4 digit node number> + <4 digit port number>

               This format is used only as a calling  address.  The
               origination  node  number is  used  for  reports for
               nodes that do  not report origination  host numbers.
               As this  should only occur  for Varian  Tymsats, the
               port number can be  assumed to be the  physical port
               number on the Varian.

           e)  9 + <1 to 9 digits>

               This format  is used  to indicated a  2 to  10 digit
               Network User Number (NUN) that is used as a username
               and  does  not indicate  the  actual  destination or
               origination of a call.  The leading 9 is included in
               the username.  If entered  at a TYMSAT for  calls to
               an X.25 or  X.75 interface, the called  interface can
               be  optioned  to  substitute  the  DNIC+NUN  for the
               actual calling  address.  If  present in  the called
               address field of a call request from an X.25 or X.75
               interface, the  NUN will be  used as a  username and
               will be left in the called address field if the call
               is to an X.25 or X.75 interface.

           f)  Not present or the single digit 9

               This format  is used  only as  a called  address and
               indicates a  request for a  direct call  (no address
               specified).   The  call  will  be  placed  using the
               Network User  Identifier given (NUI,  i.e., username
               and password).

           g)  First digits of 1  through 6 and 8 are  reserved for
               future expansion.


                               X.25 Calls

      When an X.25 DCE receives a call request from the link, the NTN of

      the called address must follow the format specified in a),  b), e)
      or f) above.

      If a) then only  the DNIC is used  for routing.  A local  table of
                                                     Page 17


      DNICs is referenced to obtain a login string that is multitargeted
      to  all the  gateways to  the specified  network.  If  the gateway
      reached is  a Tymnet/Tymnet  gateway (i.e.,  not an  X.75 gateway)
      then the digits following the DNIC will be examined and a username
      string  will be  passed  to the  other network  using  the methods
      described in b) and "X.75 calls" below.  In this case  the gateway
      login  is transparent  to  the user.   All logon  prompts  and the
      "interlink established" message from the Tymnet/Tymnet gateway are
      suppressed.  For the case  of X.25 the username will  be X25.<orig
      host  >.<our DNIC>  (where our DNIC and  orig host are  the values
      for the originating interface).  For calls from X.75 the name will
      be X75.<calling DNIC>.<our DNIC>.  In both cases the password will
      be null.  This  username is only valid  in the called  network and
      should be restricted to only originate on  Tymnet/Tymnet gateways.
      It should be additionally restricted to only allow access to hosts
      allowing international access.

>>>     The usernames  in the  table should be  validated to  only allow
      calls to international gateways.  In the future the table  will be
      eliminated and the Supervisor will perform the routing.  This will
      be  necessary  to  provide  security  for  public  dial  access as
      described later.

      If b) then the DNIC is that of the domestic network.  The DNIC may
      either be specified or  omitted.  If omitted, the leading  zero of
      the  NTN  will serve  to  indicate  a local  call  (in  which case
      additional leading zeros are not necessary).  A login string will
      be sent to the supervisor consisting of a username, a colon, the 5
      digit destination host number  and, if a subaddress is  present, a
      period and the subaddressing digits.  The username  is constructed
      by prefixing "X25." to the 5 digit originating host number  of the
      link that placed the call.  (The prefix "X25." may be  replaced by
      any 4 character string on a per link basis at system generation or
      with the XOM).

>>>     This username has a null password.   Its class is  restricted to
      originating only from its  own host number.  The username  has the
      colon  option  and  therefore its  possible  destinations  must be
      specifically stated in the seed username assigned to the customer.
      Note  that  if calls  are  to  be placed  from  this  interface to
      destinations not  owned by this  customer then both  this customer
      and  the  customer  to  be  called  must  give  permission  to the
      administrations  network  validations  department  before  a  seed

      username containing the destination  host number is added  to this
      customers  account.  The  username will  always be  used  with the
      colon option.  Therefore,  the home host will  not be use  and the
      username  cannot  itself  be  multitargeted.   In  order  to allow
      multitargeting  at the  destination, the  destination  host number
      should be multibased.

>>      Calls placed using  this username should  only be billed  to the
      owner of the username in the case where the accounting record does
      not indicate reverse charging.  If reverse charging  is indicated,
      the owner of the called  host will be billed.  Calls  to nonpacket
      mode DTEs  (i.e., TYMCOMS  and not  X.25/X.75 interfaces)  will be
      cleared  by the  X.25  DCE if  reverse charging  is  requested and
      format b) is used.

>       Before interfaces using this format may be installed in any X.25
      that  originates  domestic  calls  the  above  username   must  be
      validated  unless  the  following  condition  is  met.   Formerly,
      addresses     of    this     type    were     of     the    format
      DNIC+<4 digit host>+<0 to 6 digit subaddress>.   All   the  digits
      following the  DNIC were used  as a numeric  username.  Therefore,
      during the transition, a special global option will exist  so that
      NTN less than 6 digits will be treated as a usernames.  Also, If 6
      or more  digits are specified  and the first  6 digits  indicate a
      number greater  or equal to  n (where n  is defined by  the global
      option) then the  entire NTN will be  treated as a  username.  The
      default for n is 4000.   This will cause all host  numbers greater
      or equal  to 40  and using  the 4  digit format  to be  treated as
      usernames.  For example, 005012  in the old format  indicates host
      50  subaddress 12  but  host 5012  in  the new  format.   With the
      temporary option set to 4000, host numbers above 3999 will  not be
      allowed and 005012 will be used as a username.

      Format  c)  will  be  created  for  calling  addresses   when  the
      originating host number is known.  This is currently the  case for
      host numbers above 16000.

      Format  d)  will  be  created  for  calling  addresses   when  the
      originating host number is not known.  This is the case for Varian
      Tymsats.

      If format e)  is specified, the  interface username X25.  + <orig-
      node-number>  will  not  be  used and  the  NUN  will  be  used as
      specified in e) above.

>>      In this case billing should be done as in case b).

      If format f) is specified, the interface will look for  a username
      string in the call user data field of the call request.  This is a
      request for a direct call.

>>      Billing should be done as in case b).  The username and password
      are always striped from the  call user data field.  An  option will
      exist in the called X.25 interface which allows the  username (and
      its separator) to  be put into  the CUD field  preceding anything

      already there.  This options can be specified for X to X calls.


                               X.75 Calls

      X.75 calls are identical to X.25 calls except that for case b) the
      username  that  is  constructed  is  "X75."  plus  the originating
      network  DNIC (obtained  from  the calling  address).   The "X75."
      prefix  can  be changed  on  a per  link  basis as  in  X.25.  The
      originating network  DNIC is used  to allow restrictions  based on
      network of origination.

>>>     The X75.<orig-net> username must be validated to  only originate
      on  gateways connected  to this  originating network  (or networks
      connected  to  this originating  network).   A new  group  must be
      created  that  contains  only  those  domestic  hosts  that  allow
      international access.  The X75.<orig-net> username should  only be
      valid to terminate on this group.

>>      Accounting should be  done based on international  agreements in
      effect.

      TYMSAT logins will be as defined in the section describing the new
      login format.  The  command mode login  syntax for the  CONSAT PAD
      will be described at a later date.
