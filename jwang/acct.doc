The international accounting of Tymnet is very much conformed to the
recommendations of CCITT in 1984(d10, d11, and d12). The charging
is mainly based on the volume of information transmetted and the 
duration of the call.

The duration of the call is the interval between the call set-up and
call clearing procedures. At the beginning of the session, the supervisor
in the destination node(pass the call request packet) will be 
informed of  the billed party(collect/orgination). And the 
supervisor in the origination node(receive the call and the 
destination DTE is in its network) will receive the following
information: the invoice number, the billing method(collect/origination)
, called DTE and calling DTE addresses...etc.
  
During the session, XCOM will periodically inform the supervisor of the
number of segments and packets transmitted/received up to this point.
At the end of the session, the supervisor will receive the final
accounting report and the clearing cause.
  
Tymnet employes two kinds of measurement units for chargeable data
:segments and packets. CCITT deals only with segments. packet
counting is only a nice Tymnet feature.  For each session,
 packet size(the number of characters) is negotiateable. But one
segment can only be up to 64 bytes and data is rounded off to
the nex higher unit. And Tymnet starts to count character from
the fourth octets(after packet type) for segment count.
 
Generally speaking, for the type of billable data the accounts of 
segments are a subset of those of packets. The account of segments
includes the following packets: call request/incoming call,data
packet(including Q-bit packets), interrupt and reset request.
  
The account of packets counts the following packets:call request/
incoming call, call accept/call connected, data packets(including
Q-bit packets), interrup request, interrupt conformation,
clear request, clear conformation, reset request/reset indication,
and reset conformation.
