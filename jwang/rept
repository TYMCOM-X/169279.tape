.le;A PUBLIC FORUM WAS HELD IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY BUILDING
AT 7:00 PM ON JUNE 17, 1987.
THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING IS QUITE CLEAR. THE TOPIC OF
THE MEETING IS "THEGOLDEN TRIANGLE TASK FORCE". THIS TASK 
CONCIDERS HOW CITIES AND COUNTY WORKING TOGETHR COULD 
ADDRESS THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION PROBLEM IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY.
PARTICIIPANTS IN THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE TASK FORCE INCLUDE
THE CITIES OF MILPITAS, MOUNTAIN VIEW, PALO ALTO,
SAN JOSE, SANTA CLARA, SUNNYVALE AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY.
A PRESENTATION OF THE PRELIMINARY GOLDEN TRIANGLE TASK
FORCE POLICY PACKAGE ( CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, HOUSING, GROWTH
MANAGEMENT, AND TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT ) WAS
GIVEN FIRST, FOLLOWED BY PUBLIC INPUT. THERE WERE ORGANIZATIONS
AND PRIVATE CITIZENS GAVE THE INPUTS. THE MEETIN
FOLLOWED THE AGENDA VERY WELL. BEFORE THE MEETING BEGAN,
THE PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN THE AGENDA AND THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE
POLICY PACKAGE. SO EVERYONE CAN REVIEW AND UNDERSTAND
.d
THE AGENDA AND MATERIAL BEFORE THE MEETING. THERE WAS A
LEADER. THE LEADER CONTROLED THE PROGRESS OF THE MEETING 
VERY WELL. THE PARTICIPATION IS DEMOCRATIC. THERE WAS ONLY 
A LITTLE NTERATION. THE LEADER ONLY GAVE A SHORT COMMENT
FOR EACH SPEAKER. ALL THE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS WERE REDORED.
THE LEADER EXPLAINED THAT ALL THE ANSWERS WILL NOT GIEVN
UNTIL NEXT MEETING. ALL THE PRESENTATIONS, CONCERNS ADDRESSED
THE MEETING GOAL. THE GROUP MEMBERS SEEMED TO LISTEN
TO THE PUBLIC INPUTS VERY CAREFULLY. BUT THEY DID NOT GIVE
THE INTERACTIVE DISCUSSION ON EACH PUBLIC INPUT.
ALTHOUGH THE GROUP IS WELL-ORGANIZED, MOST OF THEM ARE
SILENT, MY OPINION ABOUT THE MEETING IS THAT IT WAS NOT A
VERY GOOD PUBLIC FORUM BECAUSE THERE WAS ONLY A LITTLE INTERACTION.
ANY INTERESTED ORGANIZATION AND PRIVATE CITIZENS
HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THE MEETING PLACE IS VERY NICE 
ANYONE FELT CONFORTABLE. 
THE OVERALL MEETING IS NOT SO BAD. AT LEAST PARTICIPANTS WERE CLEAR 
ABOUT THE SUBJECT, GOAL OF THE MEETING.
