======================================================

Raymond,

     The patches have been written to fix the 'IUS' and double echo
problem.

     (1). For IUS problem:

          a. Add two lines ';x(jwang)module.cmd' and ';@(jwang)EOB05.p01'
             right after ';@(cwhknet)bbxs05.p01' in the command file.
          b. The patch EOB05.p01 has an ius/irs/igs switch.
              If you want to use 'IRS', set '1[UIRS:' in the command file
              just right before ';@(source)bbxs05.i01'
              If you want to use 'IUS' or 'IGS', set '1[UIUS:' or '1[UIGS:'
              in the command file instead of '1[UIRS:'.
              The default value for 2780/3780 is 'IUS'.
              (hex values for IUS,IRS,IGS are '1F','1E','1D')

            (for item a and b, please take a look at sample command file
             CWHKNET:37:sampl.c04)

          c. Since we don't have 3780 host, please take away all the statements
             for host interface part. (i.e., the last 2 lines in the CWHKNET:
             37:JW2010.t04). Otherwise, it will cause some other problem
             when we try to signon.

     (2). For double echo problem:
          This is a X.75 bug. Two patches have been written to fix this 
          problem. These two patches have been put into (pactech:37:pacx02.p02).
          please put '1[IBM2780:' and '1[DEM:' in the X.75 command file to
          enable these two patches in the pacx02.p02.


Please test both 3780 terminal interface and X.75 interface. let me know
how it goes. Thanks,


regards,
james Wang
