==========================================================================


 (1). Consider two kinds of virtual circuits:

                          NETWORK
                      ____________________
                      |                  |
       Call ---> consat -----------------> X.25/X.75 host A ----->
                      |                  |
       Call ---> X.25/X.75 host B -------> X.25/X.75 host C ----->

For host A, Destination input/output segment/packet counts are used.
For host B, Origination input/output segment/packet counts are used.
For host C, Destination input/output segment/packet counts are used.

Input : packet comes from the X-link.
Output: packet goes to the X-link.

 (2). Segment input count is incremented by n when X.25/X.75 receives
      a data packet from the link. THe value n is calculated by the following
      steps:
          1. The size of this packet is divided by 64 (decimal) to get 
             quotient q and remainder r.
          2. If r equals zero then value n is set to the value q
             else n is set to the value q + 1.

      -------------------------------------------------------------------

      Packet input count is incremented by 1 when X.25/X.75 receives 
      following packets coming from the X-link:
           data packet
           interrupt/interrupt confirmation packet
           reset/reset confirmation packet

      -------------------------------------------------------------------

      Segment output count is incremented by n when X.25/X.75 interface sends
      data packet to the link. (value of n is calaulated by the same way
      described as above.)

      -------------------------------------------------------------------

      Packet output count is incremented by 1 when X.25/X.75  sends the 
      following packets to the link:
           data packet
           interrupt/interrupt confirmation packet
           reset/reset confirmation packet
     -------------------------------------------------------------------


      Character input(output) count is incremented by the size of data
      packet  sent to the link (received from the link).

 
 (3). Input segment count may be greater or less than input packet count.
      But these two counts should have only a little difference.
      
       
===========================================================================

   I have checked the X.75 slot host 23 and found there is not much different
between input/output segment count and packet count. From the ontyme #67785,
you provided me that I/P segment & packet are 48347 and 72496. There may be
something wrong in the packet level. Next time when you find the same problem,
please do the packet trace (?stat, then enter 'os' for output packet trace
or 'pb' for input trace to see if there is a lot of interrupt/interrupt conf/
reset/reset conf packets)

   According the CCITT, we may count CALL REQ ,interrupt, interrupt conf
packet in the segment count.
