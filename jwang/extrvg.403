:	This patch corrects the test for Reverse Charge Non-Acceptance (RCNA)
:	in CONUP.  The test was made on the reverse charge flag (RVCHRG)
:	which is set if reverse charge is requested.  This flag is set on 
:	calls to and from the link.  The test at CONUP should be made only
:	for calls to the link, becuase calls from the link are already
:	tested against the appropriate flag in RT.   NSR 650 DRE 3/28/86
