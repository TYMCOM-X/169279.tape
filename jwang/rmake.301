:	In RMAKE routine, R4 is loaded with GRPSAV and is modified in
:	RMK060. There is a possibility at the beginning of RMK070 to loop
:	back to RMK050 without reinitializing R4, thus corrupting R4, R2,
:	EPORT, R6, IPORT, R1 & DPORT : i.e. all possibilities of index used
:	in the related routines. This is leading to several types of crashes
:	occuring in the RMAKE routine at different locations when an 
:	instruction refers to an address wich is out of bounds (out of 
:	segment 0 for exemple) due to a corrupted index used in this
:	instruction.
:	This patch just ensures that R4 is properly restored after it has 
:	been modified in case we have to loop back to RMK050.
