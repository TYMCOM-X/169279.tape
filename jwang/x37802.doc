Sub1:  3780 Intermediate end of block 'IRS','IUS'
Sub2:  Double Echo

======================================================================



  1. 3780 environment:

     HITACHI ---- 3780 terminal -----------X.75-----X.75 --------PDP system
                  interface        (C&W)                  (TYMNET)

  2. The problems for this environment:

     (a). 3780 terminal interface uses 'IUS' (1F) as intermediate end of
          block. The IBM 3780 decument (3780 Data Communication Terminal,
          GA27-3063-3,file no 3780-09) says that IUS character is used to
          indicate an end-of-record when a block of next contains more
          than one record. But, HITACHI 3780 device can't accept 'IUS'. It
          can only accept 'IRS'.
     (b). After X.75 receives needle from network, it will echo all characters
          which are coming from IRING (i.e., sent by 3780 terminal interface).
          This causes the double echo problem.

  3. Action taken:
     Three patches have been develpoed to slove these two problems. (2.a, 2.b)
     
     For problem 2.a., the patch (jwang:37) EOB05.p01 is used to handle this
         problem. The user can have three choices---choose 'IUS' or 'IRS'
         or 'IGS' as the imtermediate end of block by adding '1[UIUS:' or
         '1[UIRS:' or 'UIGS:' in the command file. The default value for
         2780/3780 is 'IUS'. (Note that '1F' for IUS, '1E' for 'IRS', '1D'
         for IGS).
     For problem 2.b., two patches are used to turn off echo in the X.75
         interface. These two patches are added in the (pactech:37)pacx02.p02.
         The user need to set '1[IBM2780:' and '1[DEM:' in the X.75 interface
         command file to enable these two patches.

  4. All these three patches are tested in the lab. We are using HARRIS
     Work Station to emulate 3780 device. All these three characters IUS,
     IRS,IGS are acceptable by the HARRIS work station. For HITACHI device,
     we can choose one of these three characters to fit HITACHI environment.
     If HITACI can only accept 'IRS' (1E), then we can add '1[UIRS:' in the 
     command file to use it.
     Also, we shouldn't gen the tymfile with both terminal and host interfaces
     in the same slot if there is no real host line connection. So, in HITACHI
     testing environment, the ##2011.t04/##2010.t04 need to be modified to
     take away all the statements for host interface part.

  5. In the past several weeks, we have the difficulty to set up the 3780
     environment. We try to ask all the people who know how to set up the 
     environment. But, this work station seems to be forgot by them. Finally,
     we call the HARRIS corporation and get the procedure to set it up.
     We couldn't use this environment until last wednesday. Since this work
     station has been set up now, we can support C&W 2780/3780 any further
     testing more efficient.
     We are ready to send C&W these three patches for testing.
