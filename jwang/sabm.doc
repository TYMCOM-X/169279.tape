===============================================================



    1. SABM
       At the very beginning (after reloading the slot or after issuing ddt
       command 'h' followed by 'e') Tymnet X.25/X75 DCE/DTE will enter not
       armed state ('pnarm' shown on the frame trace) and sends 'sabm poll'
       out. Then, it enters into armed state ('parmg' shown on the frame trace)
       and continues to send 'SABM POLL' until it receives 'UA FINAL'.

       When it receives 'UA FINAL', the link level is up and it enters
       infomation transfer state. 
       When it receives 'UA', it will ignores it and continues to send 'SABM
       POLL' and stays in the armed state. Same if it receives other frames.

       There is not necessary that the other side ( for example, HITACHI X.25/
       X.75 interface) should send 'SABM' to bring up the link level. That is
       fine if the other sends 'SABM' to Tymnet X.25/X.75 interface.

    2. DISC
       There is a bug on the code level. let's fix it when the real testing
       catches a problem which is caused by this 'DISC' frame. I know where
       the bug is. But, there may have several situations which may cause
       'DISC' problem. We need to know the exact situation before we can fix it.
    3. IDLE line
       Tymnet X.25/X.75 will response 'RR FINAL' for receiving 'RR POLL'.

    4. FRAME REJECT FRAME
       Tymnet provides W,X,Y,Z reasons. (Same as CCITT).



============================================================================


P.S., Before I prepare a patch for the PROTOCOL ID problem, I need to know
      the following  points:

      1. What is the exact P.ID  (protocol id) in he CR packet sent by FETEX?
      2. Whta is the purpose of this P.ID? (Does it only mean that the call
         is from PAD?)
      3. If the call is from Nscnet and destinated to FETEX network, the P.ID
         in the CR packet should have '51XXXXXX'? Can FETEX handle the call
         form Nscnet to FETEX network with P.ID '01000000'?
      4. Will FETEX change the P.ID to '01000000' if the call is from pad?
