Subj:  Patch for testing call from X.75 to X.25
       ConsatPad interface

==================================================================

       The testing for the call from X.75 to X.25 was successfull
after a little bit of modification on the X.75 code. Yesterday, I had
modified the engine memory directly. I am going to write a patch and
re-assemble X.75 code with this patch and reload X.75 slot. Will let you
know when it is done. 

       ConsatPad is a new product and is still in BETATEST. Briefly speaking,
It combines together with the functions of Consat and PAD. USer terminal
connected to ConsatPad can have two MODES--LOGIN mode and COMMAND mode.
When user gets the prompt 'PLEASE LOGIN:', he is in login mode and
At this moment, user can (1) enters break key to enter command mode
or (2) enters 'username:host number;password' as he does on Consat.

When user is in command mode, he is using PAD as he is using SERTEK PAD.

James
