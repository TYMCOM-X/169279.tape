       Syntax:  DMSRCV(Ascii data string)
                Ascii data string = WCC + orders and text

       Each character defined in DMSRCV will be compared to the character
       of the local data string received by host interface.   If there
       is any difference detected, function of disconnect message sequence 
       will be terminated and circuit will be zapped.  

2.2.3  Define special devices:

       Syntax:  DMSDEV(DMS,device list)

       This macro is similar to MSGUSE.  It defines the usage of the
       previously defined messages.  This macro is used for the disconnect
       message sequence only.   The "DMS" must be used to turn on the switch
       for this special function.

       DMSSND and DMSRCV can be defined several times for customer's
       convenience. however, these two macros must be defined in order and
       alternatively.   Ascii data string must be used to define these dis-
       connect messages.   Table 1 is the EBCDIC-ASCII translation table
       for the orders which might be included in the disconnect messages.

              restriction on ASCII code orders.




       Example:

            DMSSND("5F)                      :clear key
            DMSRCV("0C3"91"20"2ELOGOFF?)     :WCC + orders(SBA,cur pos,cur pos)
                                             :+ TEXT
            DMSSND("27"20"2EYES)             :AID + Cu. Pos. + text
            DMSRCV("0C2)                     :Unlock keyboard
            DMSSND("27"20"2EBYE BYE)         :AID + Cu. Pos. + text
            DMSDEV(DMS,0,5,7-9)              :Turn on DMS switch and messages
                                             :will be handled for devices 0,5,7
                                             :8 and 9.

            Following handshaking sequence will be done whenever a
            circuit is zapped on device 0,5,7,8 and 9:

                     Host                 Host Interface

                            <-------------   Clear key
                   "Logoff?" ------------->
                            <-------------   "Yes"
                   Unlock keyboard ------->
                            <-------------   "Bye Bye"


2.3 Second greeting message

    This function is an option for the user to send second greeting message
    to host if one  greeting message is not enough to build a session
    whenever a circuit is connected.

    Macros required to perform this function are the same as those for
    GRT, DSC and ZAP.   These macros are: STMSG, MSGTEX, ENDMSG and MSGUSE.
    Parameter "GR1" must be used in the position of "fcn" in MSGUSE macros.
    First greeting message (parameter GRT) should be defined before
    second greeting message (parameter GR1) is used.  No greeting message
    will be sent if first greeting message (GRT) is undefined.   After
    receiving first greeting message, host should response with an unlock
    keyboard message to host interface.   Host interface will detect the
    response message.  If it is an unlock keyboard, host interface will
    send second greeting message.  If it is not or the response message 
    is missing,  circuit will be zapped and logon will be rejected.

    Example:
         
         STMSG
           MSGTEX(AIDCLR)
         ENDMSG
         MSGUSE(GRT,0-6)         :first greeting message is "clear" key
         STMSG
           MSGTEX(AIDENT,SP.,SP.,L.,O.,G.,SP.,O.,N.)
         ENDMSG
         MSGUSE(GR1,0-6)         :second greeting message is AID+Cursor 
                                 :Position+ Text

         Following handshaking sequence will be done whenever a circuit
         is connected on device 0 to 6.

                     Host                    Host Interface

                             <--------------  Clear key
                   Unlock keyboard --------->
                             <--------------  "Log on"


2.4 Test Request Message

    Syntax: TRQUSE(TRQ,DEV)

    This macro is similar to MSGUSE.  Parameter TRQ is used to turn on the
    Test Request Message switch.   Parameter DEV represents a list of devices
    or device ranges which is described exactly as in MSGUSE macro.  If this
    macro is defined, a test request message will be sent to host whenever a
    circuit  is disconnected.   Following is the exactly data format which is
    sent to host:

            SOH % / STX DEV# DEV# ETX

      This is a standard test request message format where DEV# is the device
      number of the device which sends this message.

      EXAMPLE:

      TRQUSE(TRQ,0,2-6)

      Device 0 and 2 to 6 will send a test request message to host whenever its
      circuit is zapped.
    
2.5 3101 24 PF keys support

    This function is implemented to support emulators of 3101 which
    have 24 PF keys.   The parameters in table 2 define the defaults
    for those keys.

2.6 3101 printer support

    Version 7.04 supports associate printers for 3101 and 470.  Please refer
    to 3270 Host Interface reference manual for associate printer configur-
    ations.



2.7 3101 read modify command and read buffer command.

    The read modify command on the  IBM 3101 is fully supported in version
    7.04.   Read buffer command  is not fully supported because  nulls are 
    not transmitted from IBM 3101 when a read buffer command is received.
    In response, the IBM 3101 transmits all data in screen buffer except nulls
    to host interface.  In the real 3270 environment, nulls are transmitted
    whenever a read buffer command is received.

2.8 Error messages to supervisor log.  (7.04)

    All error messages detected by the 3270 terminal interface or detected
    by the host interface via the established DSP error reporting mechanism
    are logged to the supervisor.  An operator may access this log via PROBE.
    The log message for each error will have the following format:

    NODE REPORT 2001 FROM SLOT# 6 PBH TYPE 20 414549

    Where 2001 is the node number
          6    is the slot of the 3270 host interface.
          PBH  stands for Polled Bisync Host, and is the mneumonic for
               3270 host interface in the standard TYMNET terminology
          20   is the error type, where in this case "20" means circuit zapped.
          41   is the line address, as defined in the TYM file
          45   is the control unit address, as defined in the TYM file
          49   is the terminal address, as defined in the TYM file


    The error type is derived from the standard DSP error codes as listed
    in the DSP manual under COMMANDS/RESPONSE UNDELIVERED and ABORTED.  The
    derivation is performed in the following manner :

                               CMD/RES    ORIGINAL      INPUT      OUTPUT

    3270 Terminal Interface     XMT        10XX ---->   10XX ----> 00-3F
                                RCV        11XX ---->   11XX ----> 40-7F
    3270 Host Interface         XMT        10XX ----->  12XX ----> 80-BF
                                RCV        11XX ----->  13XX ----> C0-FF
    Where ORIGINAL  is the error code as defined by DSP
                    10XX undelivered with code XX
                    11XX aborted with code XX

          OUTPUT    is the error type as displayed in the Supervisor log


    Below is the list of current error types and corresponding descriptions :

* Note : Unfortunately, at present Type 1 Node Report message may also
         refer to the slot being restarted.  If so, then the address 
         field would be meaningless and a host up message should immediately
         follow this node report.  An example of such a report would be :

         NODE REPORT 2023 FROM SLOT# 1 PBH TYPE 1 10200
         HOST 142 UP

















3. Terminal Interface

3.1 Host number associated with Terminal Interface (HSTPRT)

    SYNTAX: HSTPRT(H0,0)

    This macro specifies the host number (decimal) associated with the Terminal
    Interface.  This macro is required and must appear before the configuration
    macro.  "H0" is to define the host number and "0" is the port number with 
    no port defined.   This macro used in Terminal Interface is for account-
    ing purpose and port number should be equal to 0.  Any port number other
    than "0" is meaningless and wastes memory.

     Example:

          HSTPRT(900,0)

     Host 900 has 0 port associated with it.


3.2 Parameter to skip DSP screen

    Syntax:  DSPSCN EQ #

    Default: 1

    This parameter specifies whether DSP logon screen is displayed in the
    login process.   

          1   DSP logon screen will be displayed.
          0   DSP logon screen will not be displayed.

    If DSPSCN is set to 0, connection request mode (CRM) will be assigned
    to 3 automatically, i.e. host interface will provide the destination
    terminal address at call set up time.

    Example:

         DSPSCN EQ 0

     DSP logon screen will be skipped.

3.3 Screen recovery after network services.

    Whenever a network service is requested, terminal interface will send a
    read buffer command to read all data in the addressed display buffer
    and stores received data in "SAVEQ". After the service is completed,
    All data in "SAVEQ" will send back to terminal to recover the original
    screen.   Transparent data used in extended features (such as color, high-
    lighting or programmable symbols) are not currently supported. Therefore,
    the original screen might not be correctly recovered if transparent
    data described above are included.  Clear key is defined to exit network
    service to get original screen.

3.4  Node information in network service screen

     Node number, slot number, line address, control unit address and
     device address are included in network service screen.  All
     addresses are displayed in symbols.  A period is followed to end the 
     field.
     For example, "A." for "0C1" and " ." (space and period) for "40".
     Table 3. is an example of network service screen.

      and device address is 0C4.



3.5 Quick key sequence to bypass network service screen

     Three more network service keys are defined to log off current circuit and
     to logon to desired destinations.   There are PFMEN, PFMEN1 and PFMEN2.
     Table 4 describes the functions of these key sequences:

                Table 4.  Functions of network key sequence

          Preess PF4 and PF8 sequence will disconnect current circuit and
          logon to  the first destination.


3.6 Interval parameter to record polling time to supervisor log.

    Syntax:  SPLTYM  EQ  $A N

    Defaults: $A 5 (5 minutes)

    This parameter specifies the time interval which the Terminal Interface
    records the polling time to the supervisor log.   An operator may access
    this log via probe.   The log message for each line will have the follow-
    ing format:

    NODE REPORT 2001 FROM SLOT# 6 PBT TYPE 3F 1134F

    Where 2001 is the node number
          6    is the slot number
          PBT  stands for polled bisync terminal, and is the mneumonic for
               3270 terminal interface in the standard Tymnet terminology
          3F   is the report type for this kind of message.  Any message type
               other than 3F is nothing related to polling time. (Refer to 
               section 3.7)
          1    is the line number.  If the line number is 0, then this byte 
               will be skipped, i.e., there are only four bytes left in this 
               log message to display the average polling time for line 0.
          134F is the average polling time in ticks for this line.
             
3.7 Error messages to Supervisor Log

    All error messages detected by the 3270 terminal interface or detected
    by the host interface via the established DSP error reporting mechanism
    are logged to the supervisor.  An operator may access this log via PROBE.
    The log message for each error will have the following format:

    NODE REPORT 2001 FROM SLOT 6 PBT TYPE 20 414549

    Where 2001 is the node number
          6    is the slot of the 3270 terminal interface.
          PBT  stands for Polled Bisync Terminal, and is the mneumonic for
               3270 terminal interface in the standard TYMNET terminology
          20   is the error type, where in this case "20" means circuit zapped.
          41   is the line address, as defined in the TYM file
          45   is the control unit address, as defined in the TYM file
          49   is the terminal address, as defined in the TYM file


    The error type is derived from the standard DSP error codes as listed
    in the DSP manual under COMMANDS/RESPONSE UNDELIVERED and ABORTED.  The
    derivation is performed in the following manner :

                               CMD/RES    ORIGINAL      INPUT      OUTPUT

    3270 Terminal Interface     XMT        10XX ---->   10XX ----> 00-3F
                                RCV        11XX ---->   11XX ----> 40-7F
    3270 Host Interface         XMT        10XX ----->  12XX ----> 80-BF
                                RCV        11XX ----->  13XX ----> C0-FF
    Where ORIGINAL  is the error code as defined by DSP
                    10XX undelivered with code XX
                    11XX aborted with code XX

          OUTPUT    is the error type as displayed in the Supervisor log


    Below is the list of current error types and corresponding descriptions* :

    Detected     Detected

       52               circuit reset message from Host Pad


Note:
*     : Report type "3F" is defined to report average polling time to 
        supervisor log in terminal interface.  Please refer to section 3.6.
**    : Report message Type 1 may also refer to the slot being restarted.
        If so, then the address field would be meaningless and a host up
        message should immediately follow this node report.

        An example of such a report would be :

         NODE REPORT 2023 FROM SLOT# 1 PBT TYPE 1 10200
         HOST 142 UP



3.8 Bisync Operation Monitor (BOM)

   Bisync operations monitor is implemented to provide some monitoring
   facilities for the 3270 Terminal Interface.  By using these facilities
   the operator can display the status of lines, control units and devices,
   or start/stop polling on a line or a control unit.

(NOTE!  The BOM was rewritten for Version 5.05 of the Terminal Interface.
None of the commands described here are valid for Version 5.05 (or later)
of the Terminal Interface.)

3.8.1 LOGGING INTO THE BISYNC OPERATIONS MONITOR

3. Terminal Interface

3.1 Bisync Operations Monitor

    See (DNDSPEC)BOM.DOC for documentation of the Bisync Operations
    Monitor.

3.2 Define Line Macro

    A user defined ID (line number field) has been added to the DEFLN macro.
    It is the fourth field in the macro.  This number is for reference only
    via the BOM.  There must be a unique ID number for each line.  The ID
    is defaulted to the relative line number, if not specified in the
    TYMFILE (the first line configured is line zero, the second is line
    one, etc.).  See (DNDSPEC)BOM.DOC for usage of the user defined ID.
    For example:

	DEFLN(40,0F5,0,25)		:Line address 40, line ID 25

3.3 Define Control Unit Macro

    A user defined ID (control unit number field) has been added to the
    DEFCU macro.  It is the second field in the macro.  This number is for
    reference only via the BOM.  There must be a unique ID number for each
    control unit on a given line.  The ID is defaulted to the relative
    postion of the control unit on the line, if not specified in the
    TYMFILE (the first CU configured for the line is CU zero, the second is
    CU one, etc.).  See (DNDSPEC)BOM.DOC for usage of the user defined ID.
    For example:

	DEFCU(40,5)			:CU address 40, CU ID 5

3.4 Define Device Macro

    A user defined ID (device number field) has been added to the DEFDEV
    macro.  It is the third field in the macro.  This number is for reference
    only via the BOM.  There must be a unique ID number for each device on a
    given control unit.  The ID is defaulted to the relative position of the
    device on the control unit, if not specified in the TYMFILE (the first
    device configured is device zero, the second is device one, etc.).  See
    (DNDSPEC)BOM.DOC for usage of the user defined ID.
    For example:

	DEFDEV(40,C1920,2)		:Device address 40, device ID 2

3.5 Permanent Virtual Circuit Options

    Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVC) for the 3270 terminal interface
    is simulated by performing an automatic logon procedure without
    user intervention.  This logon procedure is defined in the TYMFILE
    and is stored in the slot.  When the slot is started or restarted,
    each device that is defined as PVC will automatically be logged in.
    There is a timer routine that runs periodically and checks whether
    or not a PVC defined device is logged in.  If not, this routine will
    initiate the login process for this device.

    The PVC options allow flexibility in deciding the type of retry
    mechanism desirable.  Once a retry mechanism (or PVC option) is
    chosen, it applies to all PVC devices of the slot.  In describing these
    different options, the default value of five minutes for PVCTIM is
    assumed.

    Option 1	PVC option to retry within five minutes

		Once a circuit for a PVC device is zapped, a
		circuit rebuild is attempted within five minutes.

    Option 2	PVC option to retry at an average of five minutes

		Once a circuit for a PVC device is zapped, a
		circuit rebuild is attempted at an average of five
		minutes, but an attempt may happen anytime from
		zero to ten minutes.

    Option 3	PVC option to retry after five minutes has elapsed

		Onve a circuit for a PVC device is zapped, a
		circuit rebuild is attempted after at least five
		minutes has passed, but at most ten minutes.
		This is the default option, and is the mechanism
		used by the standard 3270 terminal interface.

    Option 4	PVC option to retry immediately after non-logon zap

		Once a circuit for a PVC device is zapped during
		a non-logon session, a circuit rebuild is
		immediately attempted.  Otherwise, it is similar
		to option 1.

    For all options, after the failure of each retry, the next
    retry is five minutes later.  In order to set the desired option,
    equate PVCOPT to 1, 2, or 4 (3 is the default) in the parameter
    modification area after the ENDTYM macro in the TYMFILE.
