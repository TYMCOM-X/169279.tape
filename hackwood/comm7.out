 565869|   5| 6/16/1994|18:24|DBR|DRHODES   |SYM-DIA-ACT-NEED-COM- I spoke with cust. They had a power hit at the            site yesterday but they believe the engine was OK afterwards. It seems          that they have at least a bad async port or card. Customer is checking          other ports and will call me back...Thanks...Don Rhodes                         |+

However, according to the crash table provided, this is a 06 crash due to the   slot being out of free bufferlet. Also, the slot assembly logger shows an       assembly error with the patch file.                                             |+
 566091|   6| 6/20/1994|10:31|CSG|FISBEIN   |1. The faulty patch was corrected little after the slot was last genned. I      cannot tell what the side effect of the assembly error can be.                  2. You should enable more bufferlets with the bfrsize macro.
